<h1>Fonts</h1>

<h2>This section deals with the font resource.</h2>

<p>
When you want to draw text in your game this text is drawn in a standard Arial 12 points font, but to make more interesting or unique looking texts you will probably want to use different fonts, however. 
So, to use different fonts that you have on your computer you must create a font resource in <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>. For each font resource you specify a particular type of font from your computer 
which can then be used in your game using the <a href="../000_Using%20GameMaker/Actions/006_Draw%20actions.html">action</a> or <a href="../002_Reference/Drawing/Drawing%20Text/draw_set_font.html">
code</a> to set a font for drawing to the screen.
<br>
<br>

<i><b>NOTE : </b>If you are using the <b>Free</b> version of <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> you are limited to a maximum of 5 fonts per game. For more details see 
<a href="../000_Using%20GameMaker/Versions.html">here</a>.</i>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

To create a font resource in your game, use the item <b>Create Font</b> in the <b>Resources</b> menu or use the corresponding button on the toolbar, which will cause the following window to pop up :

<img class="center" src="../images/form_font.png">

As with all resources, you should give your font resource a unique name so that you (and <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>) can identify it while writing your game. Next you should start selecting the fonts to preview using 
the drop-down menu "Font" on the left. Beneath this section you can set other things like the size and whether the font should be drawn as <b>bold</b> or <i>italic</i> or have anti-aliasing (edge smoothing) applied. 
The preview window on the right will show you different text ranges you have selected as they will look with the size and transforms you have specified, <i>except</i> the anti-aliasing which is not visible in the preview 
but will be in your game. Please note that font scaling (especially from small to large) can give artifacts when drawn, so try to avoid this where possible.
<br>
<br>

A font typically consist of 256 characters, numbered from 0 to 255, but in general you use only a small portion of these. This is why <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> defaults to using only the characters from 32 till 127 
are stored in the font. You can, however, change the character range used to help optimise your games ie: If you only need the numbers from a specific font, then <i>only</i> select the numbers. To do this, you should first 
click the <b>Clear</b> button to clear the current range and then click on the "+" button to add a new range. This will open the following window:

<img class="center" src="../images/form_font_2.png">

This window has some buttons to help you establish a standard range for your font -

<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>The <b>Normal</b> range from 32 till 127</li>
	<li>The <b>All</b> range from 0 till 255</li>
	<li>The <b>Digits</b> range that only contains the 10 digits</li>
	<li>The <b>Letters</b>range that contains all uppercase and lowercase letters only</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
Other ranges can be used by typing in the first and last character index of the range you wish to set in the <b>Character Range</b> input boxes (If a character does not lie in the range it is replaced by a space). Apart 
from these buttons and input boxes, you also have two further options thare expecially useful.
<br>
<br>

The first is the button marked <b>From Code</b>. If you click on this button and then click OK, <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> will automatically parse your game code for strings and then create different character ranges to cover all the 
text in your game. Note that it looks for <i>all</i> strings (either within "" or '') and so may also include file names in the character ranges. However you can remove any ranges from your font resource using the "-" button at the 
bottom of the window and so remove those unwanted chracters.
<br>
<br>

The second button in this window is marked <b>From File</b> and it works similarly to that explained above. If you click on it, you will be asked to supply a file, and then once that is done you should click on OK. 
<i>GameMaker:Studio</i> will then parse the file and create character ranges for the text found within.
<br>
<br>

One final option that you have available to you is the ability to assign your font resource to a <b>texture group</b>. this can be very useful when it comes to optimising the way your game runs and the amount of texture 
swaps that must be done while the game is being played. for more information on texture groups please see the section <a href="More%20about%20backgrounds/Texture%20Pages.html">Advanced Use - Texture Pages</a>.
<br>
<br>

<i><b>Note : </b>Due to licencing issues, <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> does not store the fonts with the project file (when the game is finally finished the font is rendered to a texture page, so finished games 
will draw the text as designed). This means that if you wish to share the <tt>*.gmx</tt> or a zipped <tt>*.gmz</tt> file, you <i>must</i> include the font resource that you have used yourself, as not 
everyone will have the same fonts as you installed on their computer.</i>
