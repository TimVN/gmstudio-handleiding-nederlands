<h1>General Preferences</h1>

<h2>The section details the general preferences tab.</h2>

<p>
<img class="center" src="General_Prefs.png">

The <b>General Preferences</b> tab deals with the visual aspect of <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> as well as certain general behaviours. The following options are available :
<br>
<br>

<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li><b>Show recently edited games in the file menu</b> : If checked the eight most recently edited games are shown under the recent files in the file menu.</li><br>

	<li><b>Close compile form when complete</b> : When you run your game, it is compiled by <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> to run on the target platform, and this process is shown in the <b>compile window</b>. 
	Normally this window is always open (and can be docked at the bottom of the main window), but you may wish to only see it when only when compiling, in which case you should tick this option as it will automatically 
	close the compile window when finished.</li><br>
	
	<li><b>Delete from resource tree deletes from disk</b> : If this option is checked, when you remove a resource from the resource tree, it will also be removed from the computer. <b><i>Use 
	with caution!</b> This may lead to the accidental loss of resources.</i></li><br>
	
	<li><b>Do not launch game in fullscreen</b> : When checked, this option will override any other fullscreen functions when you launch your game and force it to start windowed. This is provided as a debug tool.</li><br>
	
	<li><b>Show commands in compile window</b> : When you create a new final app or are testing the current one (normally or in debug mode) the compile window will show the currently running 
	commands. Un checking this flag will switch off most of them and prevent the compile form from showing what is being done. The default (and recommended) value is to have this switched on.</li><br>

	<li><b>Show commands with verbose flag</b> : Thid check-box is used to switch on (or off) verbose messages in the compile window. When switched on, the default command messages that are shown 
	in the compile window (when the above "<b>Show commands in compile window</b>" is checked too) will contain far more information about the current status of the app being compiled. This may slow 
	down the app as it runs and is flagged as off by default.</li><br>
	
	<li><b>Show compile form on startup</b> : Flagging this will open the compile form automatically when you start <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>. If it is not flagged, then the compile form will only appear when 
	you first test your game or when you create the final executable.</li><br>
	
	<li><b>Enable backup on save</b> : This option can be used to switch on the automatic backups that GameMaker:Studio can make of your project. When this is enabled, you can select a <b>Backup 
	Directory</b> to save a full backup copy of the current project too, as well as the <b>Number of backups</b> that you wish to keep. Once this is enabled, everytime you save the current project 
	you will also have a backup copy saved to the choosen directory. These backups are numbered concurrently, starting at 0. Please note that the current (newest) backup is always the first! Each time you 
	save, previous backups are re-numbered with an increment of one (removing those that are numered larger than the specified number of backups) and the latest save is numbered as 0.</i></li><br>
	
	<li><b>Enable asset compiler caching</b> : This option will turn on or off <i>caching</i> for the asset compiler. For new projects this is <b>on</b> by default, but older projects may have it disabled. 
	Switching it on will mean that after an initial test build of your game, all the assets will be cached so that future compiles will be faster, with only those assets that have changed between tests being 
	re-compiled for use. Note that should any asset become corrupted, you can clear the chache using the "brush" icon at the top of the <i>Gamemaker:Studio</i> IDE.</li><br>
	
	<li><b>Use OGG Sounds</b> : Switching this option on will force <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> to use built in OGG Vorbis support for all sounds. While this may be beneficial in many cases, it is worth noting 
	that OGG has a CPU overhead as each sound file has to be decoded before it can be played.</i></li><br>
	
	<li><b>Show news in default browser</b> : Sets whether to show the <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> news in your default Internet browser, rather than in the program itself.</li><br>

	<li><b>Always reload changed files</b> : This option is to permit <i>GamreMaker:Studio</i> to reload files that are changed on the disc automatically. If this is flagged, then any images, sounds or scripts 
	that are changed from the project <tt>*.gmx</tt> file itself will be silently re-loaded into your game. if it is not flagged, you will get a message prompt asking you if you wish to change the files.</li><br>

	<li><b>Automatically increase build number</b> : When checked the build number will increase automatically.</li><br>

	<li><b>Add config and version to filename on create executable</b> : Flagging this will generate a build number (including config name, if configs are used) automatically when you create an executable 
	of your game.</li><br>

	<li><b>Do not show YoYo Games Logo in the main window</b> : When checked the image and link to the YoYo Games website in the main window are not shown.</li><br>
	
	<li><b>Do not show prompt on closing code editor</b> : Flagging this option will prevent the code or script editor asking you if you wish to save any changes and instead will silently save on close always. The 
	default (and recommended) setting for this is to have it switched off.</li><br>
	
	<li><b>Big resource tree icons</b> : Checking this will make all the resource tree icons larger (<i>GameMaker:Studio</i> must be restarted for this to show).</li><br>
	
	<li><b>Select Skin</b> : Check to use a different skin for the <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> GUI (<i>GameMaker:Studio</i> must be restarted for this to show). It should be noted that custom skins must placed 
	in the <b>Local</b> app data folder (<tt>%localappdata%</tt>) otherwise they may be over-written or removed when <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> updates.</li><br>
