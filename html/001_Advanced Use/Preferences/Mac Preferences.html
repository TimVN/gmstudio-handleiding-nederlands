For <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> to work with an Apple Mac, a few things need to be set up first in the preferences. Once you open this tab you will see the following sections that need to be filled in for 
<i>GameMaker:Studio</i> to be able to communicate properly with your Mac and for you to test your games :
<br>
<br>

<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li><b>Mac Host Name</b> - This is the name (or IP address) of the Mac on the local network that you are going to use.</li><br>
	
	<li><b>Mac User Name</b> - This is the name of the user account that will be active for testing your games.</li><br>
	
	<li><b>Mac Password</b> -  The password for the user account specified in the section above.</li><br>
	
	<li><b>Mac Install Directory</b> - The place on the Mac that you wish <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> to install the necessary files to test and run your games.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
Below these inputs is a button labelled <b>Check Mac Connection</b> which you can use to test the information you have supplied to make sure that the connection to your Mac is correct and working. Please note 
that you <i>must</i> have enabled <b>Remote Login</b> on the target mac. This can be done by going to <i>Preferences</I> -> <i>Sharing</i> and <i>enable Remote Login</I> for the user you want to be 
able to login.
<br>
<br>

Finally there is a button marked <b>Clear SSH Keys</b> which is used to clear the <i>Secure Shell Hash</i>. This is provided as an option for those users that have changed Mac, or re-installed the OS on their 
current one, and need to re-configure their secure keys.
