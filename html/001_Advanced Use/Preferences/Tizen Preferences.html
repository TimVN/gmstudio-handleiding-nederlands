The first thing to do before starting to test or create a Tizen game, is to set up this section of the preferences for the Tizen module. You must have the <b>Tizen SDK</b> installed (see the page on 
<a href="../../000_Using%20GameMaker/001_Installation.html">Installation</a>) which you would then "point" to from the file dialogue labelled <b>Tizen SDK Location</b>. Apart from the SDK you will 
also need to link to the <b>Java Runtime Location</b> as the Tizen SDK requires this.
<br>
<br>

Once you have located the necessary files, you should proceed to <b>Check the Tizen SDK</b> by pressing the appropriate button on this tab, as this will get <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> to check that 
the components  are installed and communicating with the program properly. If this shows <i>"SDK + JRE OK"</i> then you can begin to test your games on the Tizen target platform.
<br>
<br>

If your development setup permits the creation of a virtual Tizen device, you should also press the <b>Create Emulator VM</b> to initialise the Tizen emulator and create a "template" of the 
<i>GameMaker:Studio</i> virtual Tizen device, otherwise your game will not run correctly (if at all).
<br>
<br>

Finally, you can add the signing certificate that the Tizen SDK generates. This is not necessary for testing the JS (Web) Tizen module or even for creating a final <b>*.wgt</b> file, but without it your game 
will not be accepted onto the official Tizen Store. If you are compiling to the Native module, then the <b>*.p12</b> file is essential as without it your game will not compile. Further information on setting 
up the Tizen module and aquiring the necessary files can be found on the <a href="http://wiki.yoyogames.com/index.php/Setup_GameMaker:Studio_for_Tizen" target="_blank">YoYo Games Wiki</a>.
