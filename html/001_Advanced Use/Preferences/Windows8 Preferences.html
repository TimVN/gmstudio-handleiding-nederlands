<h1>Windows 8 Preferences</h1>

<h2>The section details the Windows8 preferences tab.</h2>

<p>
<img class="center" src="Win8_Prefs.png">

Here you can set up the preferences that <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> is going to use with your installation of Windows8 for testing games. Before stating to use the Windows8 target platform you <i>must</i> have 
installed the <b>Visual Studio Express 2012</b> SDK that supports building Windows Store JavaScript applications (this can be found 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads" target="_blank">here</a>). Once that is installed the values for these preferences should be automatically generated.

If these values are incorrect or are not generated automatically for you, you should do the following:
<br>
<br>

<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>Make sure that the section titled <b>VS2012 Cross Tool</b> points to the "<b>vcvarsall.bat</b>" in your MS Visual Studio installation. <i>Without this you wonâ€™t be able to successfully create Windows 
	Store packages.</i></li><br>
	
	<li>The <b>WinJS API reference</b> and <b>WinJS Api Version</b> need to match with the WinJS API that comes with your version of Visual Studio. To check this, create a blank Windows Store JavaScript 
	app in Visual Studio and, under References, right-click the <i>Windows Library for JavaScript</i> reference and select <i>Properties</i>. You should see an SDK Identity property that tells you all you need to 
	correctly fill out these details.</li><br>	
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
You should also note that for <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> to generate your app correctly, you will need a <b>Developer Key</b>. Please refer to the section <a href="../Global%20game%20Settings/Win8%20Tab.html">Global 
Game Settings - Windows8 Tab: Installation</a>.
<br>
<br>

Next you need to point <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> to the <b>Windows 8 SDK Tools</b> which you can find in the folder "../Windows Kits/8.0/bin/x86". Finally you should click on the <b>Check Windows 8 
SDK</b> button to confirm that your selections are okay and that everything works as it should. If you get an error or you are not sure that your Developer Licence is correct, you may also click on the button 
labelled <b>Acquire Developer Licence</b> which will open up a command prompt and automatically go through the necessary steps to get you one.
