<h1>Using Source Control with <i>GameMaker:Studio</i></h1>

<h2>Once you have everything setup correctly, <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> has its own set of tools for working with Source Control.</h2>

<p>
When working with your game in a source controlled setup, it is important that you follow the same steps all the time when creating, committing or reverting files in your game. To make things easier, 
below you can find a brief overview for the three main proceedures that you will need to work with.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Adding New Files</h3>
<p>
When creating a new resource for your game (whether it be a room, a sprite or a time line), there are a couple of steps that you should always take to ensure that it is correctly versioned in your source 
control repository:
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		
		<li>Create the resource and add the codes, objects, sprites etc...</li><br>
		
		<li>Save the project as the resources do not exist outside of the IDE (<i>this is very important!</i>).</li><br>
		
		<li>After saving the project, if you have not previously added any resources of this type to your repository for this project, right click on the resources root folder (so, for example, for a room it 
		would be the "Rooms "group in the resource tree), and select <i>Source Control -> add</i>. <b>This only needs to be done <i>once</i> for each resource type.</b></li><br>		
		
		<li>Right click on the new resource and also select <i>Source Control -> add</i>.</li><br>
	
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now that you have added your resources to the repository, you can continue working on them as before, only now when you change something in them, you will have to use the "Commit" function to save 
them to the repository, which is covered in the next section.
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
	<i><b>Important!</b> Don't forget to save the game project before adding to the repository! And you only need to add each resource group once to the repository, and each subsequent resource 
	created in the group also only needs to be added only once after it has been created.</i>
</blockquote>
<p>

<h3>committing Files</h3>
<p>
Adding files (as explained above) only marks the files as "to be added" to your source control repository but doesn't actually save them there. So we must now <i>commit</i> the files in order for the repository 
to hold these files. This step is very important as without it, your repository will not be up to date and you cannot use any of the source control features.
<br>
<br>

To commit files to the repository, follow these simple steps:
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		
		<li>Right click on the resource in the resource tree and select <i>Source Control -> Commit All</i> (you can also select <i>Commit</i> directly from the menu but that is for individual files and also we 
		have a lot more than just your new files to commit, as you will see).</li><br>
		
		<li>You will now get a commit dialog.
		
		<img class="center" src="SC_CommitDialogue.png"></img>
		
		At the top you can add a message which will be logged along with your commit so that others can get a general idea of what you committed, and below this you will see all files that you are going to 
		commit.</li><br>
		
		<li>You will see that there are a lot of files in there, with most of them being the config files and images. You can choose just what to commit here by deselecting items in this dialog. The left panel shows 
		file names and the checkboxes for deselecting and selecting them, while the right panel shows you the status of the file (<b>A</b>=added, <b>M</b>=modified, <b>D</b>=deleted, 
		<b>?</b>=un-versioned).</li><br>
		
		<li>For this first commit, it is recommended that you do <i>not</i> deselect anything and commit everything, adding in as a message log something like "initial commit". Now press "<b>Ok</b>".</li><br>

		<li>You will now see in the compile messages it is adding and committing to the repository. This can take a while depending on your connection and the amount of files. The first commit can be quite lengthy 
		but you are looking for the message "<b>Refreshing SVN Status...finished</b>" which tells you that everything has been done and you can continue to work on the game.
	
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now that you have done your initial commit, the process should be more or less the same from now onwards, with you editing something, saving the project and then committing the change(s) to the repository, either 
using the <i>commit all</i> or simple <i>commit</i> commands from the right click menu of the resource tree.
<br>
<br>

<font size="3"><i><b>IMPORTANT!</b> The project.gmx has to be committed manually by the user! Since the actual project.gmx does not appear in the resource tree, you should either commit it to source control 
<b>after</b> committing any changed files from your game, <b>or</b> use the "commit all" command to commit it along with the rest of the changed files.</i></font>
<p>

<h3>Reverting Changes</h3>
<p>
One of the principal uses for source control is the ability to "roll back" your game to a previous state and undo any changes that have been made. This can be of particular importance when you have added something 
that breaks the game or have made some design changes that you want to go back and add in. in situations like this you will need to use the <b>Revert</b> option.
<br>
<br>

The following steps outline how to revert to the last committed version of a file stored in the repository:
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		
		<li>Right click on a resource you wish to revert and click "<i>Source Control -> Revert</i>".</li><br>
		
		<li>You will see a message appear in the compiler form at the bottom of the IDE saying "Reverted 'xxxxx.gmx'".</li><br>
		
		<li>Your resource is now back to the previously committed version.

	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Please note that this is not reversible, unless you are reverting from an already committed change. If you make some changes without doing a commit and then revert, once you have reverted there is no going back 
to your non-committed version.
<p>

<h3>The GameMaker:Studio Interface</h3>
<p>
Once your game file has been added to your source control repository you will see that a new set of icons have been added to each resource on your resource tree. These are the <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> source 
control indicators and are used to give you a graphic representation of the versions of each of your resources and while working on your project will look a bit like this :
<br>
<br>

<img class="center" src="SC_Icons_ResourceTree.png"></img>

Obviously the exact icons you see will depend on your project and what you have been working on, but you still need to know what they all mean! The list below shows each one and explains their significance:
<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="SC_Icon_1.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Updated</b> : This shows that the resource is updated to the current version as stored in the repository.<br><br></img>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="SC_Icon_2.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Added</b> : This icon means that you have created a new resource and it has to be added into the repository. This will happen 
automatically when you save your progress.<br><br></img>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="SC_Icon_3.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Modified</b> : When you change a resource in any way this icon will appear beside it to let you know that it is now different to 
the last version in the repository.<br><br></img>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="SC_Icon_4.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Not Versioned</b> : if you see this icon it means that the resource is not recognised by the SVN Client and should therefore 
be added to the repository. There is an "add" command provided for this in the right-click menu from the resource tree.<br><br></img>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="SC_Icon_5.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Conflict</b> : if you get this icon it means there is a conflict between two resources. this can only usually happen when two or 
more people work on the same source and cannot be resolved through <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>. For that you will have to use your windows SVN Client to merge the two files or manually edit the *.gmx files.<br></img>
<br>

<p>
You can work on your game as normal, creating, changing and adding resources as necessary knowing that these changes are only being done to your <i>local</i> copy of the game, not the versioned copy stored in 
the repository. As mentioned in the sections above, a game with source control active also has an extra set of commands available from the right click menu of the resource tree. These new options deal with source 
control and look like this:
<br>
<br>

<img class="center" src="ResourceTree_Options.png"></img>

As you can see there are two most common actions that need to be performed:
<br>
<br>

<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Commit</b> : This will commit the selected resource to the source control repository. If you have a folder selected then everyting in that folder will be committed, otherwise it will only commit 
		the selected resource. 	When you commit something you will also be prompted to add a comment where you can briefly explain what you have added or changed, and this will then be stored along with 
		the updated version of your project.</li><br>
		
		<li><b>Update</b> : This will update the selected resource (or resources if you have a folder selected) in your local copy of the project from the repository. Any changes, additions or conflicts will now 
		show up in <i>GameMaker:Studio</i></li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
Below those two actions, you also have a further sub-menu titled "Source Control". There are further actions that you can perform listed here:
<br>
<br>

<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Add</b> : Normally you will have no need to use this action as <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> takes care of adding any new resources you create into the repository, but in some special cases it may 
		be neccessary to manually add a resource into the repository. When this happens you will get the <img src="SC_Icon_4.png"> "Not Versioned"</img> icon showing that you need to use this action.</li><br>

		<li><b>Refresh Status</b> : This simply refreshes the source control icons beside the resource (or resources if you have a folder selected) to reflect the current versioned status.</li><br>

		<li><b>Revert</b> : With this action you revert the selected resource, or resources if you have a folder selected, to the <i>last version you have updated to</i> from the repository.</li><br>
		
		<li><b>Commit All</b> : Commits <i>everything</i> into the repository. You will be prompted to save your work to the local copy before committing.</li><br>
		
		<li><b>Refresh All</b> : This simply refreshes the status icons beside all the resources.</li><br>

		<li><b>Revert All</b> : Use this to revert all changes that you have done back to the <i>last version you have updated to</i> from the repository.</li><br>

		<li><b>Update All</b> : This will update all resources in your local copy of the project from the repository. Any changes, additions or conflicts will now show up in <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>.</li><br>
	</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
It should be noted that there is no option to rename any resource as this is handled internally. So, when you have source control enabled and you rename (for example) a sprite, <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> will 
automatically change and update your local copy of the project without any need for your intervention. these changes will then be added to the repository on the next commit.
