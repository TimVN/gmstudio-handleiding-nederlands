<h1>Source Control</h1>

<h2><i>GameMaker:Studio</i> incorporates a complete source control system, ready to use with any one of the SVN packages available.</h2>

<p>
<b>Source Control</b> is the name given to the method of working with <i>sub-versions</i> using the free licence Apache Subversion (often abbreviated to <i>svn</i>), which is installed in the form of an 
independent software package to control all the aspects of maintaining, changing and comparing versions of your game as you work on it. This is especially useful to those that work in a team and need to be 
able to control who does what and not worry about losing data or making changes that may need to be undone at a later date, but individuals can benefit from this powerful yet flexible system too.<br>
