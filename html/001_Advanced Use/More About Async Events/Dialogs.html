<h1>Dialogs Event</h1>

<h2>This is the sub event that will be triggered by any user event function call-backs received.</h2>

<p>
Like the above events, the <b>Dialogs</b> event is only triggered when it gets a call back from one of the special asynchronous user functions, like 
<a href="../../002_Reference/Asynchronous%20Functions/get_login_async.html"><tt>get_login_async()</tt></a> (please see this function for an extended code example of how this event is used). These events are 
the ones that ask for some type of user input, which can be a name, login details, a number or a color etc... As most devices do not like sitting in a loop waiting for a reply, they have to be asynchronous and 
<i>GameMaker:Studio</i> will continue to run in the background while these functions have a dialogue open and until they get the required user input which triggers this event.
<br>
<br>

Again, a <a href="../../002_Reference/Data%20Structures/DS%20Maps/index.html"><tt>ds_map</tt></a> is returned with the id held in the special variable <b>async_load</b>. The values held in this map will 
depend on the function used, and you should consult the individual entries for each function in this manual for more details.
<br>
<br>

<p>
<i><b>NOTE : </b>The map held in the <tt>async_load</tt> variable is only valid in these events, as the ds_map that is points to is created at the start of the event, then deleted again at the end, with this 
variable being reset to a value of -1 in all other events.</i>
