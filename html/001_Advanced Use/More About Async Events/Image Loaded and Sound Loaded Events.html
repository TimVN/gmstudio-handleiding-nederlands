<h1>Image Loaded and Sound Loaded Events</h1>

<h2>This is the sub event that will be triggered by any resource call-backs received.</h2>

<p>
These two events are triggered when you load an image or a sound into <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>, as long as you have used a valid URL with the applicable load file function. For example say you want to 
load a background image, and only change the current background to the new one when it has loaded. Well you would have something like this in a create event or an alarm event (for example):
<br>
<br>

<p class="code">
back = background_add("http://www.angusgames.com/game/background1.png", 0, 0);
</p>

<p>
This will now start to load the image into the device or the browser, but it will <i>not</i> block <i>GameMaker:studio</i> while it waits for the file to be loaded. Instead <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> will keep 
running as normal until the image is loaded and the call back triggers the <b>Image Loaded</b> event, where a <a href="../../002_Reference/Data%20Structures/DS%20Maps/index.html"<tt>ds_map</tt></a> 
(more commonly known as a "dictionary") is created and stored in the special variable <b>async_load</b>. The map contains the following information:

<blockquote>
<ol>
	<li><b>"filename": </b>The complete path to the file you requested.</li><br>
	
	<li><b>"id": </b>The ID of the resource that you have loaded. This will be the same as the variable that you have assigned the resource to.</li><br>
	
	<li><b>"status": </b> Returns a value of less than 0 for an error.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
You would then assign the newly loaded image to a background in this event. The above is also true for sprites and sounds, with a ds_map being generated for each of these resources as shown above, and the 
following code example demonstrates how the returned information would be used in this event:

<p class="code">
if ds_map_find_value(async_load, "id") == back<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ds_map_find_value(async_load, "status") >= 0<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background_index[0] = back<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
</p>

<p>
The above code will first check the id of the ds_map that has been created, then check the status of the callback. If the value is greater than or equal to 0 (signalling success) the result from the callback will 
then be used to set the background index to the newly loaded image.
<br>
<br>

<p>
<i><b>NOTE : </b>The variable <tt>async_load</tt> is only valid in these events, as the ds_map that is points to is created at the start of the event, then deleted again at the end, with this variable being 
reset to a value of -1.</i>
