<h1>HTTP Event</h1>

<h2>This is the sub event that will be triggered by any http call-backs received.</h2>

<p>
The HTTP Event is one that is triggered by the call back from one of the <a href="../../002_Reference/Asynchronous%20Functions/index.html"><tt>http_</tt> functions</a>, like 
<a href="../../002_Reference/Asynchronous%20Functions/http_post_string.html"><tt>http_post_string</tt></a>. It actually generates a ds_map (more commonly known as a "dictionary") that is exclusive to this event 
and is stored in the special variable <b>async_load</b> (please see the individual functions for code examples that explain the use of this event in further detail). This ds_map has the following structure :
<blockquote>
	<ol>
		<li><b>"url": </b>The complete URL you requested.</li><br>
		
		<li><b>"result": </b>The data received (string only).</li><br>
		
		<li><b>"http_status": </b>The raw http status code (if available). This returns the standard web status code for most browsers, eg: 304 for "Not Modified" or 204 for "No Content", etc...</li><br>
		
		<li><b>"id": </b>The ID which was returned from the command. If you fire off a series of <tt>http_</tt> requests then you need to know which one you are getting the reply to, and so you would use this 
		value to compare to the value you stored when you originally sent the request to find the right one.</li><br>
		
		<li><b>"status": </b> Returns a value of less than 0 for an error.</li>
		
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
That is for when you use the <tt>http_post_string()</tt> function, but each of the <tt>http_</tt> functions will return a slightly different map, so please refer to the manual entry for each function to find out 
the precise data that is returned for it.
<br>
<br>

<p>
<i><b>NOTE : </b>The variable <tt>async_load</tt> is only valid in these events, as the ds_map that is points to is created at the start of the event, then deleted again at the end, with this variable being 
reset to a value of -1.</i>
<br>
<br>

<i><b>NOTE : </b>As <tt>async_load</tt> creates a <a href="../../002_Reference/Data%20Structures/DS%20Maps/index.html"><tt>ds_map</tt></a>, these functions are particularly useful when coupled with the 
<a href="../../002_Reference/File%20Handling/json_encode.html"><tt>json_encode</tt></a> and <a href="../../002_Reference/File%20Handling/json_decode.html"><tt>json_decode</tt></a> functions.</i>
