<h1>IAP Event</h1>

<h2>This is the sub event that will be triggered by any IAP call-backs received.</h2>

<p>
This event can only be triggered by the <a href="../../002_Reference/In%20App%20Purchases/index.html">In App Purchases</a> functions and will return some very specific results depending on the target module that is 
used as well as the functions being called. The following circumstances are those that will trigger this event:
<blockquote>
<ol>
	<li>The store state changes.</li><br>
	<li>A product changes state:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>On confirmation from iOS store.
		<li>On purchase.
		<li>On completion of downloaded files.
	</ul>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
Along with this event there is a special function that can be called to get a <a href="../../002_Reference/Data%20Structures/DS%20Queues/index.html"><tt>ds_queue</tt></a> of values so that you can check to see 
if any of the above criteria have been met and react accordingly. For more information on this function please see 
<a href="../../002_Reference/In%20App%20Purchases/iap_event_queue.html"><tt>iap_event_queue</tt></a>.
<br>
<br>

<p>
<i><b>NOTE : </b>The <tt>ds_queue</tt> created by the above function is only valid in this event, as it is automatically deleted at the end of the event by GameMaker:Studio.</i>
