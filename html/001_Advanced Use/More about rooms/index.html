<h1>More About Rooms</h1>

<h2>This chapter covers the more complex aspects of Rooms in <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>.</h2>

<p>
In a previous section of the manual (see <a href="../../000_Using%20GameMaker/Rooms/index.html">Using GameMaker : Rooms</a>) we covered the <b>Settings</b>, the <b>Objects</b>, and the <b>Backgrounds</b> tabs, 
but there is still much that the room editor can do, and these advanced features will be covered in the sections below.
<br>
<br>

<h3>The Right Click Menu</h3>
<p>
A very important tool when it comes to using the room editor is the <i>Right Click Menu</i>. If you place an instance within the room and then right click on it with the mouse, you will see the following pop-up menu :

<img class="center" src="ObjectMenu.png"></img>

<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li><b>Delete : </b>This will delete the instance selected.</li><br>
	<li><b>Delete All : </b>This will delete </i>all</i> the instances found at the point where you clicked in the room.</li><br>
	<li><b>Edit Object : </b>Use this to open the object properties window.</li><br>
	<li><b>Creation Code : </b>This option opens up a code editor where you can add code into the specific instance that you have clicked on. This is a very powerful feature that allows you to further change individual 
	instances of objects and so give several instances different values or variables to change their behaviour. This code is run <i>after</i> the normal create event, but <i>before</i> 
	the room start event (see <a href="../../000_Using%20GameMaker/Events/index.html">Using GameMaker : Events</a> for the complete order of events).</li><br>
	<li><b>Instance Properties : </b>Clicking this will open a further window where you can set some of the basic start properties for the instance, like blend color, image angle, scale and alpha.
	<img class="center" src="InstanceProperties.png"></img>
	</li><br>
	<li><b>Change Position : </b>All this does is permit you to place the instance exactly at any position within the room. A window will open where you can input a new x and y position, and when you close it the instance 
	will change to the new position.</li><br>
	<li><b>Snap to Grid : </b>This will snap the instance to the nearest node of the defined room grid.</li><br>
	<li><b>Copy Selection : </b>This will copy the currently selected instance (or instances) to the clipboard. Multiple instances can be selected using &lt;Shift&gt; and Left Clicking on them.</li><br>
	<li><b>Paste Selection : </b>This will paste the instance (or instances) currently on the clipboard, and this can even be used in a different room so that you may copy instances from one room to another.</li><br>	
	<li><b>Locked : </b> Clicking this will "lock" the instance, meaning that it cannot be moved or deleted from the room without previously unlocking it again (right click and select "Locked" again to unlock).</li><br>
	<li><b>Rename Object Instance : </b>This option permits you to give your instance a name. Normally an instance is given an "id" when it is created, which is usually something like "<i>inst_A4F595D9</i>". Now 
	there are many moments when creating a game that you wish to refer to a specific instance through code, and remembering a name like that is not easy! So you can assign a name to it by selecting this and use that as 
	a constant to refer to this instance from now on. Be aware that refrencing an instance in this way after it has been destroyed may cause an error.</li><br>
	<li><b>Copy Instance Name : </b>Simply copies the name of the instance into the clipboard.</li><br>
</ul>
