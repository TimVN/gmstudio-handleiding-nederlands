<h1>The In App Purchases Tab</h1>

<h2>This section deals with the In App Purchases tab of the Global Games Settings Window.</h2>

To enable in app purchasing capabilities with your <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> title, you should check the <b>“Enable In App Purchase”</b> check-box available on this tab. If you wish to make use 
of a proprietary web server for retrieving available products (allowing you to dynamically update the set of products available for a title without the need to update your title) and/or for verifying Apple 
Store receipts then fill in the Server URL option (e.g. http://purchases.yourcompany.com/), otherwise leave this blank.
<br>
<br>

If you are wanting to test the IAP functionality on an iOS device, then you should check the <b>"Sandbox Mode (iOS)"</b>. This is to be used for iOS apps when a proprietary server is in use for retrieving 
available purchases and for verifying content. This will add “<code>&amp;sandbox=true</code>” or “<code>&amp;sandbox=false</code>” to the query string parameters for the verification url (i.e. it 
will now be
<blockquote>
<code>
http://{yourserverurl}/admin/verify?receipt={receipt_data}&amp;sandbox={flag})<br>
</code>
</blockquote>
<p>
This allows you to target the correct apple.com URL for verifying the receipt whether in development (sandbox) or a released product. You should also note that for iOS, the 
<a href="iOS%20Tab.html">iOS Global Game Settings</a> <b>App id</b> must have the correct reverse URL format, EG: com.[Company].[GameName]
<br>
<br>

Below this is the <b>Android</b> section, where you can mark your game as using the <b>Amazon Store</b>, and you can also choose to suppress any "restoring Market Transactions" messages 
should you be using <b>Google Play</b>. A further section is supplied for Google Play too, which is a space for adding in your <b>Android Public Key</b>. This is a key code supplied by Google 
as a protection method for your game. This licence can be found by going to your <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/Home" target="_blank">Google Play Developers Page</a> and then 
selecting the option <i>Edit profile</i>. Once on the profile page, scroll down to the section titled "<i>Licensing &amp; In-app Billing</i>" and there you should find the Public key that is needed for 
this functionality to be enabled.
