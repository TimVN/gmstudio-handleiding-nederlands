<h1>The Advertising Tab</h1>

<h2>This section deals with the Advertising tab of the Global Game Settings window.</h2>

<p>

<img class="center" src="Advertising_Tab.png"></img>

This tab can be used to set up and control the add providers you use for your games, as well as how their adverts are displayed within your game. There are three <i>sub-tabs</i> provided for each of the 
target platforms that permit advertising (Android, iOS, HTML5 and Windows Phone), but they all have the same layout as that pictured in the above window example.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Enabling Ads</h3>
<p>
To switch advertising on for your game, you must first check the box labelled "<b>Enable Advertising</b>" and then select the advertiser that you wish to use as the provider from the drop down menu shown:

<h3>Testing Ads</h3>
<p>
If you wish to test out your adverts in a test game or to see how they look, you can also check the box labelled "<b>Use Test Ads (where available)</b>", and, depending on the provider, you should be able 
to compile and run your game with advertising coming though as you would see it in a "live" game, but without it actually counting towards your ad revenue. For more information on this feature and to see which 
companies support it, please see the section <a href="../../002_Reference/Advertising%20and%20Analytics/index.html">Reference - Advertising and Analytics</a>.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Ad Providers</h3>
<p>
Each target has a different set of advertising providers (the image above is just an example) and the list will change as more become available. Once you have chosen your provider, you should then choose which 
advert type you wish to display in your game. this is done by supplying the <b>Key</b> that the provider has given you for the advert type and by selecting the <b>shape</b> of the advert as it should be shown 
within your game. These shapes will vary from provider to provider, but the image below is a general example of the ones that are available and their sizes based on the specifications given by the 
<a href="http://www.iab.net/" target="_blank">International Advertising Bureau</a>:

<img class="center" src="Ads_Examples.png"></img>

You should note that there is one final add-type that may be available for your provider, and that is <i>interstitial ads</i>. These normally take the form of full page adverts which can be offer walls (essentially a 
page to promote several different advertising campaigns), virtual currency deals, or a video and there are a number of specific functions that can be used to launch those ads should the provider permit them.
<br>
<br>
 
When you have finished specifying your provider and the ads you wish to support, you will then need to set them up from within your game code using the functions found in the section: 
<a href="../../002_Reference/Advertising%20and%20Analytics/index.html">Reference - Advertising and Analytics</a>.
<br>
<br>
