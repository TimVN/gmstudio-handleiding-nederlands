One of the features of using <b>Google Play</b> for your Android games is the ability to <i>licence</i> your games. This means that your games will be controlled by Google so that only people that have 
downloaded it through their market will be able to play the game, thus avoiding illegal copies of your product from getting distributed.
<br>
<br>

To activate this function in your game, you must first flag the <b>Enable Google Licensing</b> box and then copy your <i>Public Key</i> into the box as shown in the above image. This licence can 
be found by going to your <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/publish/Home" target="_blank">Google Play Developers Page</a> and then selecting the option <i>Edit profile</i>. Once on the profile 
page, scroll down to the section titled "<i>Licensing &amp; In-app Billing</i>" and there you should find the Public key that is needed for this functionality to be enabled.
<br>
<br>

Once activated, if anyone who is not authorised to posses your game tries to play it, they will be shown a pop-up message box that will inform them that the Licence cannot be found on their device, and then 
give them the option to retry and test again, or exit the game.
<br>
<br>

<i><b>NOTE: </b>This functionality is limited to the <a href="../../000_Using%20GameMaker/Versions.html">Professional Version</a> of <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>.</i>
