<h1>The General Options Tab</h1>

<h2>This section deals with the general options of the Global Games Settings Window.</h2>

This tab deals with a couple of general aspects of how GameMaker:Studio will run your game.
<br>
<br>

Here you can choose the color to be drawn when the view goes outside of the room region (default is black), and you can generate a unique Game Identifier which can be accesed in your game by using 
the constant <a href="../../002_Reference/Miscellaneous/game_id.html"><tt>game_id</tt></a>. The button to generate this id also re-creates the <b>Game GUID</b> hash which can then be 
copied to the clipboard with the help of the button below for use in your applications and games. 
<br>
<br>

You also have the option to turn off or on the new Audio Engine that <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> uses. Due to incompatabilities you cannot have both the new audio engine <i>and</i> the legacy sound engine 
active at the same time. For old games created with other versions of <i>GameMaker</i> or for those games started before the new audio engine was added, the Legacy Audio will be used as default, while for 
all new games <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> will default to the new audio system. However, you can change this at any time by flagging (or un-flagging) this option. For more information on the new Audio Engine, 
please see the section on <a href="../../002_Reference/Game%20Assets/Sounds/index.html">Game Assets - Sound</a>.
