<h1>The Resources Menu</h1>

<h2>Here you can find out all about the various options available to you from the drop down resource menu.</h2>

In this menu, you can create a new resource for each of the different types as well as change the global game settings, add Constants, define Triggers and select files 
to include in the final game (more information on each of these items can be found further on in the manual). For each of these commands there is also a button on the tool-bar 
and a keyboard shortcut.
<br>
<br>

<blockquote>
