<h1>The Run Menu</h1>

<h2>Here you can find out all about the various options available to you from the drop down run menu.</h2>

<br>

This menu has options that relate to testing your games and to setting up configurations (note that each of these items has a corresponding button on the GUI Toolbar):
<br>
<br>

<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Run Normally : </b>This will cause the game to run as if it was finished and installed on the target platform for play testing.</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Run in Debug Mode: </b>This option runs the game in debug mode. For a windows game, this opens another window (apart from the game window) with various debug options which you can see below:
		<img class="center" src="Run_Menu_Debug_Image.png"></li>
		For more information on debugging in <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>, please see the section <a href="../../001_Advanced%20Use/011_Debugging.html">Advanced Use - Debugging</a>.
		<br>
	</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
The following two options are limited to the <a href="../../000_Using%20GameMaker/Versions.html">Professional Version</a> of <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> and will not be present on other versions:
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Configuration Manager : </b>Selecting this will open the Configurations Manager.</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Configurations: </b>Placing the mouse over this option will open up a sub-menu with a list of all the currently available configurations from which you can select one to use (this shows the same 
		options as the configurations tab in the <a href="../004_The%20Graphical%20User%20Interface.html">main GUI</a>.</li>
		<br>
	</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
<i><b>NOTE : </b>Although the Windows 8 target is similar to the HTML5 one, it won't allow multiple instances of the same app to run at a time, and if the file is running it can't overwrite it. This means that you 
will have to close the app before saving/testing a new version.</i>
