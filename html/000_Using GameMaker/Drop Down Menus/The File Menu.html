<h1>The File Menu</h1>

<h2>Here you can find out all about the various options available to you from the drop down file menu.</h2>

In the file menu you can find the commands you'd expect for loading and saving files, but there are also a few special ones :
<br>
<br>

<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li><b>New : </b>Choose this command to start creating a new game from scratch. If the current game has changed you are asked whether you want to save it before proceeding. There is also a 
	tool-bar button for this command, but both will methods will take you back to the "Welcome" screen where you can create a new project.</li>
	<br>
	
	<li><b>Open : </b>Opens a <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> game file with the extension <b>*.gmx</b>. You can also open old .gmk or .gm6 files from here, but if you want to open .gmd files created 
	with version 5 of GameMaker you must select the appropriate file type from the special dialog at the bottom right of the open form. <i>These might not work correctly in the new version due to 
	changes in GameMaker over the years.</i> There is a tool-bar button for this command and you can also open a game by dragging the file into the actual <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> window.</li>
	<br>
	
	<li><b>Recent Files : </b>Use this sub-menu to open game files you have recently opened or modified.</li>
	<br>
	
	<li><b>Save : </b>Saves the game project file under its current name with the <b>*.gmx</b> extension. If no name was specified before, you are asked for a new name. You can only use this command 
	when the file has been changed and, again, there is a tool-bar	button for this. Saving with this command will only save those things that have been changed since the file was opened.</li>
	<br>
	
	<li><b>Save As : </b>Saves the current game project file under a different name. You are asked for a new name before saving. </li>
	<br>	

	<li><b>Save All: </b>Saves the game project file under its current name with the <b>*.gmx</b> extension. If no name was specified before, you are asked for a new name. Unlike the regular "<b>Save</b>" 
	command, this will export and save <i>all</i> the game information, whether it has changed or not.</li>
	<br>
	
	<li><b>Export Project : </b>Exports your project as a <i>compressed GameMaker file</i> with the format <b>*.gmz</b>. These project files contain <b>all</b> the information relevant to your current 
	project (including resources, extensions, game information etc...) which can then be imported again into <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> as a complete project in the future. This is very useful for transferring a project 
	over a network as well as for storing	shelved projects or backup copies of a current project.</li>
	<br>	
	
	<li><b>Create Application : </b>Once your game is ready you will probably want to give it to others to play! By using this command you create a stand-alone version of your game. The actual files produced will 
	depend on the target module chosen in the drop down menu of the <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> GUI.</li>
	<br>	
	
	<li><b>Preferences : </b>This will open the <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> preferences where you can adjust how the program looks as well as different
	behaviours when dealing with resources etc... For further information on this please see <a href="../../001_Advanced%20Use/Preferences/index.html"><i>GameMaker:Studio</i> Preferences</a><br></li>
	<br>
	
	<li><b>Exit : </b>We know that making games is fun and addictive, but you need to eat and sleep sometimes! So press this to exit <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>. 
	If you changed the current game project then you will be asked whether you want to save it before the program closes.</li>
<br>
</ul>
