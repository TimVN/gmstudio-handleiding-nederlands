<h1>Using Expressions And Variables In Actions</h1>

<h2>This section covers how to use expressions and the in-built instance variables in actions.</h2>

<p>
When using many of the actions in <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> you are expected to input a value as one of the parameters, but sometimes that is not enough and you may find it necessary to input a 
formula or an expression to get the required result from the action. this is perfectly valid and <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> permits the use of any of the in-built instance variables, constants or global 
variables as well as the use of your own (previously defined) variables and even mathematical formula! The image below shows how this can work :

<img class="center" src="../../images/Action_Expression.png">

As mentioned before, <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> also has a great number of in-built variables that are unique to each and every instance created in a room. These instance variables are created for you 
automatically when you create an object and can be used, set and changed just as you would any other variable. Below is a list of all these variables :

<blockquote>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="../../002_Reference/Movement%20and%20Collisions/Movement/x.html"><b>x</b></a> : the x-coordinate of the instance in the room. Changing this will position the instance elsewhere in 
		the room.<br><br>

		<li><a href="../../002_Reference/Movement%20and%20Collisions/Movement/y.html"><b>y</b></a> : the y-coordinate of the instance in the room. Changing this will position the instance elsewhere in 
		the room.<br><br>

		<li><a href="../../002_Reference/Movement%20and%20Collisions/Movement/hspeed.html"><b>hspeed</b></a> : the horizontal speed (in pixels per step) at which the instance is moving. A positive value means 
		movement to the right and a negative value means movement to the left.<br><br>

		<li><a href="../../002_Reference/Movement%20and%20Collisions/Movement/vspeed.html"><b>vspeed</b></a> : the vertical speed (in pixels per step) at which the instance is moving. A positive value means 
		movement to the bottom and a negative value means movement to the top.<br><br>

		<li><a href="../../002_Reference/Movement%20and%20Collisions/Movement/direction.html"><b>direction</b></a> : the current direction of motion in degrees (0-360), where 0째 is right, 90째 is up, 180째 is left and 
		270째 is down.<br><br>

		<li><a href="../../002_Reference/Movement%20and%20Collisions/Movement/speed.html"><b>speed</b></a> : the current speed of motion in the current direction. For a "forward" motion (ie: facing the direction) 
		this is a positive value, and for a "backwards" motion it should be negative.<br><br>

		<li><a href="../../002_Reference/Objects%20and%20Instances/Instances/Instance%20Properties/visible.html"><b>visible</b></a> : this is the flag that sets an object as being visible (the draw event 
		is performed) or invisible (the draw event is skipped).<br><br>

		<li><a href="../../002_Reference/Objects%20and%20Instances/Instances/Instance%20Properties/image_index.html"><b>image_index</b></a> : this variable indicates which subimage in the current sprite 
		is currently shown. When the animation speed (image_speed, see below) is set to a value greater than 0, this 
		variable changes each step to reflect the sub-image being shown of the animation .<br><br>

		<li><a href="../../002_Reference/Objects%20and%20Instances/Instances/Instance%20Properties/image_speed.html"><b>image_speed</b></a> this variable indicates the speed with which the subimages 
		are shown, with the default value being 1 (meaning 1 frame per step). If you make this value larger than 1 some subimages are skipped to make the animation faster, and conversely, if you make it lower 
		than 1, then some sub-images are repeated over various steps to make it animate slower.<br><br>

		<li><a href="../../002_Reference/Objects%20and%20Instances/Instances/Instance%20Properties/id.html"><b>id</b></a> : the unique identifier (an integer) of the instance. This value is assigned 
		to the instance when it is created and cannot be changed.<br><br>

		<li><a href="../../002_Reference/Objects%20and%20Instances/Instances/Instance%20Properties/object_index.html"><b>object_index</b></a> : this is the <i>index</i> (not the name) of the object that 
		the instance has been created from. This value is assigned to the instance when it is created and cannot be changed.<br>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

Further information on in-built <i>instance</i> variables can be found in the following sections :

Apart from the in-built instance variables, we also have a number of <i>global</i> variables that can be used in actions too (see 
<a href="../../002_Reference/001_GML%20Language%20Overview/Variables/index.html">Variables And Variable Scope</a> for more information on global variables). Here are a few of those available :

<blockquote>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="../../002_Reference/001_GML%20Language%20Overview/Variables/score.html"><b>score</b></a> : the current value of the score<br>
		<li><a href="../../002_Reference/001_GML%20Language%20Overview/Variables/lives.html"><b>lives</b></a> : the current number of lives<br>
		<li><a href="../../002_Reference/001_GML%20Language%20Overview/Variables/health.html"><b>health</b></a> : the current health (0-100)<br>
		<li><a href="../../002_Reference/Mouse,%20Keyboard%20and%20Other%20Controls/Mouse%20Input/mouse_x.html"><b>mouse_x</b></a> : x-position of the mouse<br>
		<li><a href="../../002_Reference/Mouse,%20Keyboard%20and%20Other%20Controls/Mouse%20Input/mouse_y.html"><b>mouse_y</b></a> : y-position of the mouse<br>
	</ol>
