<h1>The Asynchronous Event</h1>

<h2>The asynchronous event is one of the many events that can be triggered in an instance and may contain code or actions.</h2>

<p>
<b><img src="../../Images/Event_Web.png" align="middle" align="left">Asynchronous Event</b>
<br>
This event is special in that it is not triggered by <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> itself, but rather by the end of some other action, like the loading of a file, or the reply from a web server. The actual event is split into 
various <i>sub</i> events:

<img class="center" src="Async_Menu.png">
<br>
<br>
So, say you want to add an image file to <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>. Well, you would code this in another event (maybe the create event) of an instance and then have that instance draw a loading bar while waiting 
from the callback that tells <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> that the file has loaded. This callback triggers the Asynchronous Event where you would then do something else, like go to another room.
<br>
<br>
