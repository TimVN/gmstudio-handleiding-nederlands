<h1>The Trigger Event (Obsolete)</h1>

<h2>The trigger event is one of the many events that can be triggered in an instance and may contain code or actions.</h2>

<p>
<b><img src="../../images/Event_Trigger.png" align="middle" align="left">Trigger Event</b>
<br>
A trigger event is an event that permits the user to define special conditions which will "trigger" a set of code or actions to run. When you add a trigger event you will be presented with a menu of <i>sub</i> events like this :
<br>
<br>

<img class="center" src="Trigger_Menu.png">
<br>
<br>

The first two things you see on that menu are just examples of triggers that have been defined previously (these were created to give an example and are not standard <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> triggers), and the last 
section, "Add/Modify Triggers", is where you would define them so that they show up on this menu.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Important</h4>
<p>
The trigger event has been made obsolete in <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> and the references to it in this manual are only due to the fact that previous versions of <i>GameMaker</i> may have them. In this case it is important
#to know how they worked so as to make importing these older projects easier. For more in depth information on triggers, please see the following section of the manual -
