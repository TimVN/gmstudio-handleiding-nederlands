<h1>The Create Event</h1>

<h2>The create event is one of the many events that can be triggered in an instance and may contain code or actions.</h2>

<p>
<img src="../../Images/Event_Create.png" align="middle" align="left"> <b>The Create event</b>
<br>

This event happens when an instance of the object is first created, and is the very first thing that happens within an instance placed in the room through the room editor when a room is entered. This means that 
this event is the ideal place to initialise variables, start Timelines, set paths etc... and do anything else that generally only needs to be done once or only when an instance first appears in the room.
<br>
<br>

<i><b>NOTE: </b>This event will always be called the moment an object is created.</i>
<br>
