<h1>Activating GameMaker:Studio</h1>

<h2><i>GameMaker:Studio</i> requires an internet connection to activate your licence before you can use it.</h2>

<p>
Once you have installed your version of <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> you will be prompted to enter a License Key the first time you run the program (unless you have downloaded the <a href="Versions.html">
free version</a> or you have bought the program through <b>Steam</b> in which case this step can be skipped as your licence is tracked by Steam for you).
<br>
<br>

The license file will also be emailed to you using the email address you entered during purchase, and if you've 
logged into the YoYo Games store through the "My Account" section, it will also be tied to that account, allowing you to retrieve it at any time should that be necessary. If you don't have a YoYoGames login, 
the email will also contain details of the new account that has been automatically setup using the email address you have provided. This will, again, let you retrieve your <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> License code from 
the YoYoGames website. Once you have completed the licence process, <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> will be ready to use!
<br>
<br>

If at anytime in the future you need to re-install <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>, the latest version, complete  with all available updates, can always be found 
<a href="http://www.yoyogames.com/download/studio/full" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br>
<br>

<b><i>It is your responsibility to make sure you save the email, and the Licence Key itself, as you will need it anytime you want to reinstall GameMaker:Studio.</i></b>

<h4>Important</h4>
<p>
While <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> itself does not require an internet connection to be used, it will require occasional access to maintain the license activated. If you cannot connect your computer to the internet 
for any long period of time, you can download the <b>license check file</b> from the YoYo Games website, and then point the auto update system to it. If you fail to provide a valid license file, or there is no 
internet connection when requested, your copy of <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> will not work until such time as this is resolved.
</p>

<h3>Additional Modules</h3>
<p>

<i><b>NOTE : </b> These extra modules can only be bought if you have already upgraded to <a href="Versions.html">GameMaker:Studio - Professional</i></a>.
<br>
<br>

GameMaker:Studio comes with two export options included when you buy it : Windows and Mac OSX (and Steam Workshop if you bought the program from Steam). However the additional modules can be 
purchased easily from <a href="http://www.yoyogames.com/game_showcases/294/purchase/express.html" target="_blank">YoYo Games Checkout</a>. Once there, all you have to do is fill in the required 
information (e-mail address and <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> base license), then select the target module or modules that you wish to add. Once this has been done, clicking "Proceed" will take you to the 
purchase page of Google Checkout to confirm the sale. Finally, once confirmed, you will be given the new license and an email with it will be sent to the address you have given.
<br>
<br>

To use this License, you must now start GameMaker:Studio and go to "Help", "Update License" and enter your new license in the appropriate area. Once that is done, you should close <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> 
and re-start it to enjoy the functionality of the new modules that you have purchased.
<br>
<br>

<h4>Buying Additional Modules From Steam</h4>
<p>
If you bought <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> through <b>Steam</b> you can also purchase these modules easily on-line from the same service, with no licence being required as Steam keeps track of your details 
for you. To access the available modules, you must run your Steam Client, go to the Library and right click on the <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> entry. From the right click menu that pops up you should select the 
option <b>View Downloadable Content</b> which will open the application <b>Properties</b> window and there you can select, buy and install the module of your choice.
