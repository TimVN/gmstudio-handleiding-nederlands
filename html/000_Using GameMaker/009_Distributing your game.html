<h1>Distributing Your Game</h1>

<h2>Here we talk about how you can distribute your finished game</h2>

<p>
With the information in the preceding sections of this manual you can begin to create your games, but when your game is finished you obviously want other people to play it. You can of course export a *.gmz 
file and let them use <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> to play it but this is normally not what you want! First of all, you don't want others to be able to change the game or get access to all your hard work, and 
secondly you also want people to play the game even if they do not have a copy of <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>. So you would like to create a stand-alone application or package of your game, or upload it as 
HTML5 to a site on the internet so that everyone can play it!
<br>
<br>

<h3>Creating Your Stand Alone Game</h3>
<p>
Creating stand-alone applications is very easy with <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>. First you have to choose the "target" for the files to be made which means choosing whether you wish to create an *.exe for windows, 
generate JavaScript and HTML for use in a browser, or create a package for iOS or Android. You then go into the <b>File</b> menu and select the item <b>Create Executable</b> or you can press the following 
button, found on the main IDE toolbar beside the Play and Debug buttons:
<br>
<img src="../Images/createEXE.png" align="middle" align="left"> <b>Create Executable For Target</b>
<br>
Either option will open a save window where you can give the final name that you wish to use for your game file. Once you have done this, the necessary files will be generated so that you can distribute it as you wish.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Target Platform Formats</h3>
<p>
Each target option saves to a platform specific format:
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>If you have the setting as "Windows" in the main <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> window, then <b>only</b> a windows compatible file will be made. This can be an installer, a stand-alone <tt>*.exe</tt> 
		or a <tt>*.zip</tt>. The export file type is choosen from a drop down menu within the "Save" dialogue itself, as shown by the image below:
		
		<img class="center" src="Windows_Export.png"></img>		
		</li><br>
		
		<li>If you have chosen to build HTML5, then an index.html (default name, but you can give your own name too) along with a folder containing your game's files will be created and saved to the specified 
		location. For your game to work you will need <b>both</b> of these to be uploaded to a server. The index.html can also be customised to show your game with a different background color, or at a different 
		position etc... but a knowledge of the HTML language is necessary for this (see the <a href="../001_Advanced%20Use/Global%20game%20settings/HTML5%20Tab.html">HTML5 Tab</a> of the 
		<a href="../001_Advanced%20Use/Global%20game%20settings/index.html">Global Game Settings</a>).</li><br>
		
		<li>For Android devices, a *.apk file will be generated which can be used directly on any Android devices or uploaded to the Google Play or Amazon stores (or any other site that accepts Android apps).</li><br>
		
		<li>For an iOS  or Mac build you will need all the appropriate developer permissions and an Apple Mac computer. <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> will create a *.dish file which you will then need to prepare in the 
		<b>Application Oven</b> app on a Mac. This will then generate your iOS or Mac app for you.</li><br>
		
		<li>For the Windows 8 (JS and Native) module an <tt>*.appx</tt> file will be created, along with it's manifest and a number of other files that are needed for your game to work as a native Windows 8 app. 
		These will all be stored in a folder in the location (and with the name) of your choice.</li><br>
		
		<li>For the Windows Phone device target module, an <tt>*.xap</tt> file is generated which can then be used by all compatible devices or uploaded to the MS Store.</li><br>
		
		<li>For the Tizen target module, a <tt>*.wgt</tt> file is generated which can then be used by all compatible devices or uploaded to the Tizen app stores.</li><br>
		
		<li>If you have bought <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> through <b>Steam</b> then you can also compile to the <b>Steam Workshop</b>. For more information see <a href="Steam%20Workshop.html">here</a>.
		
	</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
<i><b>Please note : </b>GameMaker:Studio uses a C++ runner to create all final games and apps. The previous GameMaker versions used Delphi, so this means that any game imported from previous versions 
<b>may not work</b> without certain changes.</i>
<br>
<br>

Fo further information on how to compile a final game for your target platform, and for details on how to upload these to the various app stores available, please see the 
<a href="http://wiki.yoyogames.com/index.php/" target="_blank">YoYo Games Wiki</a>.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Distribution</h3>
<p>
Once you have created a stand-alone application or package for your game you can then give the file to other people or place it on your website to download. You can also upload these files to the different 
hosting services for individual distribution or to online stores (like Google Play, iTunes or the MS Store) for general distribution and retail.
<br>
<br>

Further information on these formats and file creation can be found on the <b><a href="http://wiki.yoyogames.com/index.php/GameMaker:Studio" target="_blank">YoYo Games Wiki</a></b>
<br>
<br>

You are free to distribute the games you create with <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> in any way you like, and this means that you can even sell them! Of course, this assumes that the sprites, images, and sounds 
you used to make it can be distributed or sold as well and that you have the legal rights to all assets. See the enclosed license agreement for more information on this (available on the 
<a href="004_the%20Graphical%20User%20Interface.html">Licences Tab</a>).
