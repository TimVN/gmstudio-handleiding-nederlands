<h1>Non-Consumables</h1>

<h2>This section gives a simple example of how to setup a non-consumable purchase.</h2>

<p>
A <i>non-consumable</i> in app purchase is something that can only be bought once and no more. Typical examples of a non-consumable purchase is the user paying to remove ads, or to get extra levels for the game, 
or even to unlock features that would be otherwise unavailable. They are an excellent way to create one product with a "trial" mode (perhaps with adverts and limited levels) that can then be upgraded to the "full" 
game through an in app purchase.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Activating The Non-Consumable</h3>
<p>
For this example, we are going to create a non-consumable for removing ads from our game as this is a fairly standard option for many of the "freemium" games that are out there. To start with we need to use 
the function <a href="iap_activate.html"><tt>iap_activate</tt></a> (which would normally be placed in the <a href="../../000_Using%20GameMaker/Events/Other%20Event.html">Game Start Event</a> of the first 
object, in the first room of your game):
<br>
<br>
<p class="code">
var purchaseList, purchase1;<br>
purchaseList = ds_list_create();<br>
purchase1 = ds_map_create();<br>
ds_map_add(purchase1, "id", "10001");<br>
ds_map_add(purchase1, "title", "No Ads");<br>
ds_list_add(purchaseList, purchase1);<br>
iap_activate(purchaseList);<br>
ds_map_destroy(purchase1);<br>
ds_list_destroy(purchaseList);<br>
</p>

<p>
<br>
You can add in a price and a description into the <tt>ds_map</tt> for the purchase if you wish, but these are not necessary as the price will be set by you on the store and the description is just a convenience for 
you to display later should you wish. You also do not need to provide the download URL, nor a local path as we are not downloading any content at all.
<br>
<br>

We then need to add in a check to see if this purchas has <i>already</i> been made, and if it has then we can switch off ads for our game. For that we would have (in the same event as above) the following 
code:
<p class="code">
if iap_is_purchased("10001")<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;global.Ads = false;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;global.Ads = true;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ads_enable(0,0,0);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
</p>

<p>
<br>


<h3>Purchasing The Non-Consumable</h3>
<p>
Once that has been done, we need to have an event that actually sends off a buy request. Now, there are many ways that this can be done, but it is recommended that you do this in some way outside of the main 
game loop and have checks in place to test and see if the device is connected and the store is available. For example, you could have a menu button that when pressed creates the IAP buy object, deactivates all other 
instances and then does it's checks and "listens" for replies from the store in the IAP Async event. In this way, it is obvious to the user that there is a purchase being processed and they can do nothing else until it is 
either finalised or cancelled.
<br>
<br>

So, you should have a button object or something that checks the global variable we have set when we checked the purchase previously and if it is still flagged as <tT>true</tt> (ie: not bought), then we can 
create a new object for in app purchases and add this code into it (in the mouse pressed event, for example):
<br>
<br>
<p class="code">
if iap_store_status() == "Available"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//The store is available so send off the purchase order...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iap_acquire("10001");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//the store is not available so do some error handling here...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
</p>

<p>
<br>
That code will send off the purchase request and now you will have to wait for the call-back from it.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Handling The Purchase</h3>
<p>
The actual purchase itself will be handled by the asynchronous <a href="../../001_Advanced%20Use/More%20About%20Async%20Events/IAP.html"> IAP Event</a>, which will be triggered when the purchase goes through 
(or when the store changes status). An example of the necessary code for this event would be as follows:
<br>
<br>
<p class="code">
var i, q;<br>
q = iap_event_queue();<br>
repeat(ds_queue_size(q))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i = ds_queue_dequeue(q);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if i == 0<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if iap_is_purchased("10001")<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;global.Ads = false;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ads_disable()<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//Add further code to notify the user, save to ini, reactivate the game instances etc...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//You may want to add additional checks here for other purchases if you have them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
</p>

<p>
And your non-consumable is now bought! As you can see, the process is very similar to that which is used for Consumables, with the main difference being that once a non-consumable has been flagged as 
purchased, you do not buy it again.
