<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The density of something is defined as its mass per unit volume, which basically means <i>how much mass is crammed into the space it takes up in the world</i>. So, a balloon would have a low density as 
it has little mass that occupies a large space, while a lead bar would have a high density as it has a great mass, yet occupies little space.
<br>

<p>
In the <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> 2D physics world mass is calculated automatically for you from the values you input for the <b>density</b> and by the <b>surface area</b> of the shape you define for 
the fixture. This will have a direct impact on how much inertia a fixture has as well as how it reacts to collisions and forces, so if you make a small shape with a high density it will have a very large mass (like a 
bar of lead), but if you define a large shape with a low density it will have a much smaller mass (like a balloon).
<br>
<br>

<i><b>Note : </b>If you wish the instance that is going to recieve the fixture to be static (ie: immobile in the game world) then the density should be set to 0, essentially giving it an infinite density.</i>
<br>

<h3>Example :</h3>
<p class="code">
physics_fixture_set_density(fix_Balloon, 0.1);
<p>
The code above will set the density of the fixture indexed in "fix_Ballon" to 0.1.
