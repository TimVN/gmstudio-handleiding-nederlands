<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The pulley joint is used to connect two instances within the physics world in such a way that moving one will directly influence the movement of the other. These joints are first anchored in the world space at 
two points, each one connected to an instance at its center of mass. This can be changed by setting the local anchor x/y coordinates relative to the origin of the instance, meaning that the actual connection 
from the instance to the physics world anchor point can be offset somewhere other than its origin. The following image illustrates this:
<br>
<br>

<p>
If you look at inst2 you can see that its local anchor point has been offset 20 pixels to the "left" of its origin (Remember! The world anchor points are defined using the room coordinates, while the local anchor 
points are defined relative to the origin of the instance). You can also specify a ratio for the pulley joint, which tells one side or the other to move faster, with a value below 1 making the first instance move faster 
(E.G. 0.5 will make it move twice as fast) and a value above 1 making the second instance move faster (E.G. 2 will make it move twice as fast), as well as a maximum length that each instance is permitted to 
extend to from its corresponding joint anchor, relative to the x/y anchor position for that joint.
<br>
<br>

As with all the joints, if you set the "col" value to <tt>true</tt> then the two instances can interact and collide with each other but <i>only</i> if they have collision events, however if it is set to <tt>false</tt>, 
they will not collide no matter what.
<br>

<h3>Example :</h3>
<p class="code">
var t_fix, inst1, inst2; <br>
t_fix = physics_fixture_create(); <br>
physics_fixture_set_circle_shape(t_fix, 20); <br>
inst1 = instance_create(150, room_height - 90, obj_Block); <br>
inst2 = instance_create(300, room_height - 90, obj_block); <br>
physics_fixture_bind(inst1, t_fix); <br>
physics_fixture_bind(inst2, t_fix); <br>
physics_joint_pulley_create(inst1, inst2, 150, room_height - 140, 300, room_height - 140, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 120, 120, 0); <br>
physics_fixture_delete(t_fix); <br>
</p>
<p>
The above code creates and defines a new fixture, creates two instances of "obj_Block", and then binds this fixture two them. It then goes on to define a pulley joint between these instance, with no offset for the joints, a ratio 
of 2:1 (meaning that inst2 will move faster), and a maximum length of 120. No collisions occur between the two instances in the pulley.
