<h1>Physics Joint Constants</h1>
  
<h2>This section lists the constants associated with physics joints.</h2>

<p>
There are a great number of constants included within the <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> GML that are specific to <i>joints</i> between fixtures in the physics world. These can be used in conjunction 
with many of the different joint functions to set or get information from them in real time while the physics simulation is running. You should be aware, however, that complex calculations are done when 
you call these, so they should be used with care and only when necessary and note that <i>many are unique to a specific type of joint</i>.
<br>
<br>

<h3>General</h3>
<p>
The following constants can be applied to any of the available joint types:
<div class="compat">
	<table>
		<tr><th>Constant</th><th>Description</th></tr>

		<tr><td>phy_joint_anchor_1_x</td><td>The x coordinate of the first anchor point of the joint <i>in the room</i></tr>
		<tr class="alt"><td>phy_joint_anchor_1_y</td><td>The y coordinate of the first anchor point of the joint <i>in the room</i></tr>
		<tr><td>phy_joint_anchor_2_x</td><td>The x coordinate of the second anchor point of the joint <i>in the room</i></tr>
		<tr class="alt"><td>phy_joint_anchor_2_y</td><td>The y coordinate of the second anchor point of the joint <i>in the room</i></tr>
		<tr><td>phy_joint_reaction_force_x</td><td>This is the reaction force being applied to the second instance in a joint at the x anchor position</tr>
		<tr class="alt"><td>phy_joint_reaction_force_y</td><td>This is the reaction force being applied to the second instance in a joint at the y anchor position</tr>
		<tr><td>phy_joint_reaction_torque</td><td>This is the torque being applied to the second instance in a joint at the anchor position</tr>
	</table>
</div>

<h3>Motors</h3>
<p>
These constants are for those joints that have a <i>motor</i> attached to them:
<div class="compat">
	<table>
		<tr><th>Constant</th><th>Description</th></tr>

		<tr><td>phy_joint_max_motor_force</td><td>The value specified when the joint was created for the maximum motor force</tr>
		<tr class="alt"><td>phy_joint_max_motor_torque</td><td>The value specified when the joint was created for the maximum motor torque</tr>
		<tr><td>phy_joint_motor_force</td><td>The current motor force</tr>
		<tr class="alt"><td>phy_joint_motor_speed</td><td>The current motor speed</tr>
		<tr><td>phy_joint_motor_torque</td><td>The current motor torque</tr>
	</table>
</div>	

<h3>Revolute Joints</h3>
<p>
For a revolute joint you can use the following constant (as well as the <i>motor</i> constants if one has been added):
<div class="compat">
<table>
	<tr><th>Constant</th><th>Description</th></tr>
	
	<tr><td>phy_joint_angle</td><td>The angle that a line between the two anchor points of the joint makes. This is calculated using the <i>physics world</i> coordinates
	<br>(<b>not</b> the <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> room coordinates) in degrees.</tr>
		
</table>
</div>

<h3>Prismatic Joints</h3>
<p>
For a prismatic joint you can use the following constant:
<div class="compat">
<table>
	<tr><th>Constant</th><th>Description</th></tr>
	
	<tr><td>phy_joint_translation</td><td>Gets the distance between the anchor x/y coordinates and the local x/y coordinates.</tr>
	<tr class="alt"><td>phy_joint_speed</td><td>The current joint movement speed.</tr>
	
</table>
</div>

<h3>Pulley Joints</h3>
<p>
For a pulley joint you can use the following constants (as well as those for distance joints):
<div class="compat">
<table>
	<tr><th>Constant</th><th>Description</th></tr>

	<tr><td>phy_joint_length_1</td><td>This will return the length of the joint from the first local x/y coordinates to the first anchor x/y coordinates</li>
	<tr class="alt"><td>phy_joint_length_2</td><td>This will return the length of the joint from the second local x/y coordinates to the second anchor x/y coordinates</li>
		
</table>
</div>

<h3>Distance Joints</h3>
<p>
For a distance joints you can use the following constants (as well as those for pulley joints):
<div class="compat">
<table>
	<tr><th>Constant</th><th>Description</th></tr>

	<tr><td>phy_joint_damping_ratio</td><td>The damping ratio is non-dimensional and defines the "springiness" of the joint. The value for this constant is typically between 0 and 1, but can be larger, and 
	at 1, the damping is critical meaning that all oscillations should vanish.</li>
	<tr class="alt"><td>phy_joint_frequency</td><td>This will return (or set) the ocillation frequency for the joint, in hertz, and typically the frequency should be less than a half the frequency of the time step, 
	as set by the function <a href="../The%20Physics%20World/physics_world_update_speed.html"><tt>physics_world_update_speed</tt></a>.</li>
