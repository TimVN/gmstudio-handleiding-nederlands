<h1>Surfaces</h1>

<h2>This section deals with the functions related to creating and manipulating surfaces.</h2>

<p>
In certain situations you might not want to directly draw to the screen but rather to a "canvas" that can then later be manipulated and drawn to the screen when needed. Such a canvas is called a surface, 
and surfaces can be a very powerful graphic tool when making games using <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>. For example, you can use surfaces to "catch" instances, which can then be destroyed, and in this 
way you can create a decal effect where the sprite for the instance is displayed on the surface as if it still existed, permitting graphical effects like debris, blood, etc... without any real processing overhead. 
Another thing you can do with surfaces is use them as textures to be manipulated, or to create sprites "on the fly", or to create complex overlays. in fact, the uses for surfaces are endless!
<br>
<br>

Surfaces are quite easy to use, but there are a few basic rules to be followed when you use them:
<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>First, you should realise that surfaces are "volatile". This means that if the device or window loses focus or is minimised (good examples are when a screensaver comes up in Windows, or on an Android 
	device when the app loses focus due to a call) then the surface may be destroyed. This is because it is stored in the vRam and may be overwritten when the target platform needs that memory for something 
	else which means that you should <i><b>always</b></i> have some type of fail-safe code in place, usually with the <a href="surface_exists.html"><tt>surface_exists</tt></a> function.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<li>Second, you should note that surfaces require large quantities of vRam to be used, and so you should attempt to keep them as small as possible. Normally you would try and keep them no larger 
	than the size of the view or display window.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<li>Third, you should try to draw to surfaces in the draw event. This is not always possible, but due to the optimised way in which <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> draws to the screen, it is recommended that you 
	keep all draw functions <i>within the draw event</i>.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<li>Fourth, when drawing to a surface manually, the surface is <i>always</i> at the position of (0,0) within the room. This means that you may need to convert absolute coordinates into local coordinates 
	for the surface. For example, if you have a view-sized surface and wish to draw something that is currently in view to that surface, you should subtract the view x and y coordinates from the actual x and y 
	coordinates to get a relative position to the surface (0,0) position. So, the code would look something like this:
	<br>
	<br>
		<p class="code">
		if view_current = 0<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surface_set_target(surf);<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with (obj_Effect)<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;draw_sprite(sprite_index, image_index, x - view_xview[1], y - view_yview[1]);<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surface_reset_target();<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
		else<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;draw_surface(surf, 0, 0);<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
		</p>
	
</ul>
</blockquote>	
	
<p>
The basic use of a surface would be as follows - You first create a surface and assign it's index to a variable. You would then set the drawing target to the surface rather than the display and draw the things 
you wish as well as perform any other manipulations. Once you are done you reset the drawing target so that all further drawing happens on the screen again. One thing to note is that should you require 
drawing the whole display to a surface (including tiles, backgrounds etc...) you should assign a surface to a view using the variable <a href="../Windows%20And%20Views/Views/view_surface_id.html">
<tt>view_surface_id[0..7]</tt></a>. In this way, all that is visible in that view will be drawn to the corresponding surface.
<br>
<br>

The following functions exist to deal with surfaces:
<blockquote>
<ol>
	<li><a href="surface_exists.html">surface_exists</a><br>
	<li><a href="surface_create.html">surface_create</a><br>
	<li><a href="surface_create_ext.html">surface_create_ext</a><br>
	<li><a href="surface_set_target.html">surface_set_target</a><br>
	<li><a href="surface_reset_target.html">surface_reset_target</a><br>
	<li><a href="surface_copy.html">surface_copy</a><br>
	<li><a href="surface_copy_part.html">surface_copy_part</a><br>
	<li><a href="surface_get_height.html">surface_get_height</a><br>
	<li><a href="surface_get_width.html">surface_get_width</a><br>
	<li><a href="surface_getpixel.html">surface_getpixel</a><br>
	<li><a href="surface_free.html">surface_free</a><br>
	<li><a href="surface_save.html">surface_save</a><br>
	<li><a href="surface_save_part.html">surface_save_part</a><br>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
These functions are specific for creating and manipulating surfaces, but to actually draw them to the screen you should be using the specific draw functions that can be found in the section on 
<a href="../Drawing/Drawing%20Surfaces/index.html">Drawing Surfaces</a>.
