<h1>Immersion Haptics</h1>

<h2>This section deals with haptic effects for Android devices.</h2>

<p>
This section deals with the <i>haptic</i> functions available to you for your games. Haptics is the way that you can use vibration on your device to communicate information to the player, and in 
<i>GameMaker:Studio</i> this comes courtesy of the <b>Immersion API</b>.
<br>
<br>

Before you can use these effects you must have ticked the "Use Haptics" check-box on the <a href="../../../001_Advanced%20Use/Global%20game%20settings/Android%20Tab.html">Global Game Settings Android Tab</a> and 
have accepted the Immersion EULA that is shown. If you do <i>not</i> accept, then any use of these functions will cause your game to fail on being compiled and you will have to remove them.
<br>
<br>

It is also highly recommended that you download and install the Immersion <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.immersion.EffectPreview&hl=en" target="_blank">
Haptic Effects App</a> onto your test device, as this permits you to test a basic version of all the available effects and so get a "feel" for what they can achieve and for what is correct for your game.
<br>
<br>

It is also worth noting that many users do <i>not</i> like these effects so you should try and code your game with some way to switch these off, and you should also not abuse these effects since it can drain the 
battery life of the device quicker, and also end up annoying the end user.
<br>
<br>

Below you can find a list of all the device specific control functions:		
<blockquote>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="immersion_play_effect.html">immersion_play_effect</a><br>
		<li><a href="immersion_stop.html">immersion_stop</a><br>
	</ol>
