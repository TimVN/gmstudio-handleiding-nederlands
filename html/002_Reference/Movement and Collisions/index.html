<h1>Movement and Collisions</h1>

<h2>These sections all deal with moving objects and collision checking</h2>
<p>

When making any game there are many different ways that you can get an instance from A to B. However, not all methods are the same and some are considerably better in certain circumstances 
than others! For example, in a platform game you would probably want to involve gravity and friction in the movement, whereas for a top down game it would probably be better to use a relative 
coordinate system. And just as there are many different ways to move an instance, there are also many different ways to stop an instance too, and so this part of the manual also has a section 
dedicated to <i>collision checking</i>. Finally, there is a section on <i>motion planning</i> which is another system for movement that can be used to actually avoid obstacles and collisions.
<br>
<br>

The following sections list all the available functions dealing with movement and collisions :
