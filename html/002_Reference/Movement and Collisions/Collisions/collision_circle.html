<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
Collision circle creates a circular zone of the radius given by the user around the points x1,y1 and then checks that zone for a collision with <b>any</b> instance of the object specified by the argument "obj". 
This check can be either precise or not, but for precise collisions to be enabled, the object or instance that you are checking for <i>must</i> also have precise collisions enabled for their sprite. If not, the default 
check is based on bounding boxes. The following image illustrates how this works :
<br>
<br>

<img class="center" src="collision_circle_illustration.png"></img>

<p>
Here, the instance in the middle is using a collision circle to check for ball objects. Now, the blue ones do <i>not</i> have a precise bounding box and as you can see, even if the sprite is not actually touching 
the circle, the collision can still happen (even if you set the precise option in the function to true) as the bounding box of that sprite over-laps the circular area defined by collision_circle. On the other hand, the 
green balls will only be considered in collision if the actual sprite over-laps with the defined circle. Remember, for precise collisions to be considered <i>both</i> the object sprite and the collision function must 
have precise marked as on. It should also be noted that the return value of the function can be the id of <i>any one</i> of the instances considered to be in collision.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Example :</h3>
<p class="code">
if collision_circle(x, y, 20, obj_Cursor, false, true)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;image_index = 1;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
else image_index = 0;
</p>
<p>
The code above will check a circular are with a 20pixel radius for a collision with "obj_Cursor" and if there is one it will set the image_index of the object running the code to 1, but if there is not it will set the 
image_index of the object to 0.
