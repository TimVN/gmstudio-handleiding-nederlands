<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
This function is used to determine the orientacion of the particle sprite when it is created and can also be used to make the particle orientacion increase or decrease over it's lifetime. The minimum 
and maximum orientation values default at 0 but these values can be changed to randomise the orientation following the standard <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> directions of 0ï¿½ being right, 90ï¿½ being 
up, 180ï¿½ being left and 270ï¿½ being down. If you set them to the same value the particles will all be created with the same orientation.
<br>
<br>

You can also set an increment value which will add (if a positive number) or subtract (if a negative number) an amount of degrees to the orientation over its lifetime. This value can be a 
minimum of (+/-) 0.01.
<br>
<br>

You can set the "wiggle" factor too, the same as other particle functions. This is a value that will be added or subtracted randomly to the orientation each step of the particles lifetime. Obviously
larger values are more pronounced than smaller ones, and this value can even be a negative with the maximum range being between -20 and 20.
<br>
<br>

Finally, you can choose to have the orientation relative or not, which means that while the particle has a direction (and speed) the particle sprite will be orientated around that vector. Bear in mind 
that if you have the particle speed set to reduce and it reaches 0, the lack of speed sets the direction to the default value of 0ï¿½ and so a relative orientation will cause the particle sprite to "jump" 
to a different angle.

<h3>Example :</h3>
<p class="code">
part_type_shape(particle2, pt_shape_spark);<br>
part_type_size(particle2, 0.10, 0.50, 0.01, 0);<br>
part_type_scale(particle2, 0.30, 0.30);<br>
part_type_color1(particle2, 8454143);<br>
part_type_alpha1(particle2, 0.50);<br>
part_type_speed(particle2, 4, 4, -0.07, 1);<br>
part_type_direction(particle2, 0, 359, 0, 20);<br>
part_type_orientation(particle2, 0, 359, 0, 20, 1);<br>
part_type_blend(particle2, 1);<br>
part_type_life(particle2, 1, 5);<br>
</p>
<p>
The above code will set various particle values including the orientation which will be random value between 0ï¿½ and 359ï¿½. It will also have a random amount added to it of anywhere between 0 
and 20 each step too, and the orientation is relative to the direction of motion.
