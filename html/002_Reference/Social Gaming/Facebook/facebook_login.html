<h1>facebook_login</h1>
  
<h2>Logs the user into their Facebook account.</h2>

<h3><b>Syntax :</b></h3> 
<p class="code">facebook_login(permissions)</p>

<p>
<br>
</p>
<div class="param">
<table>
	<tr><th>Argument</th><th>Description</th></tr>

	<tr><td>permissions</td>
	<td>The permissions you want to have from the user logging in.</td></tr>
	
</table>

<p>
<b>Returns : </b>N/A
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
With this function <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> will connect to Facebook and ask the user to log into their account. You may also supply additional permission requests in the form of a ds_list that this function 
then converts into a <tt>json</tt> array to communicate them to Facebook. There are a wide variety of permissions you may request and they are documented on the Facebook developers pages found 
<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/permissions/" target="_blank"> here</a>. If you do not wish to ask for any special or extended permissions then you will still need to send 
a ds_list, but this time it will be empty.
<br>
<br>

This function is also considered as being <i>asynchronous</i> as while the Facebook login window is open on the screen, the game will continue to run in the background and even once the user has completed 
the login process, none of the other Facebook functions will work until the <a href="facebook_status.html"><tt>facebook_status()</tt></a> returns "AUTHORISED" . Due to the need for an internet connection 
and the different rates of data transfer, this means that it could be several seconds before this authorisation is received, and all the while the game will still be running.
<br>
<br>

<i><b>NOTE : </b>Take care over what special and extended permissions you request as Facebook recommends that they are only used in very specific circumstances.</i>
<br>
<br>

 <p>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Example :</h3>
<p class="code">
facebook_init();<br>
permissions = ds_list_create();<br>
ds_list_add(permissions,"publish_stream");<br>
facebook_login(permissions);<br>
</p>
<p>
The above code will initialise Facebook and then log the current user in, asking for the extend "publish_stream" permission which will allow the game to publish directly to the users wall without asking the user if 
this is permitted every time.
