<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
A Facebook dialog is the way in which Facebook asks the user to give comments and information and they not need any additional permissions because they require user interaction. For example, it can be 
used to send friend request or to post a comment to a wall. The "graph_path" argument is where you define the part of the graph you wish to access, and the exact path can be defined using the terms 
outlined in the Facebook <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/" target="_blank"><b>Dialogues Overview</b></a>.
<br>
<br>

The next argument is slightly more complex as it requires you to have created and filled a <a href="../../Data%20Structures/DS%20Maps/index.html"><tt>ds_map</tt></a> with the correct information which 
<i>GameMaker:Studio</i> will then convert into <tt>json</tt> automatically when sent to the Facebook Api. The information that you put in this map will depend very much on which path you choose to 
use and a complete list of all possible values can be found <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/" target="_blank">here</a>. An example of how this map is structured can be seen 
in the code example supplied below.
<br>
<br>

Finally, we have an argument for storing any information that Facebook has sent back from the graph request. This information comes in the form of <tt>json</tt> which <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> converts 
into a ds_map. For this to work correctly, you <i>must</i> have created a ds_map previously, and if that map has been used elsewhere and already contains some key/value pairs it will be cleared by this function 
before the Facebook data is added. It is <i>very important</i> that you read the Facebook documentation on possible return values so that you know exactly what to expect. Thankfully Facebook have a 
<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer?method=GET&path=100002950182313" target="_blank">Graph Api Test Page</a> where you can check different graph paths and see exactly what 
information they will return.
<br>
<br>

 <p>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Example :</h3>
<p class="code">
var interactiveMap;<br>
interactiveMap = ds_map_create();<br>
ds_map_add(interactiveMap, "picture", "http://MacSweeneygames.com/Clown.jpg");<br>
ds_map_add(interactiveMap, "link", "http://MacSweeneygames.com/");<br>
ds_map_add(interactiveMap, "name", "Catch The Clown");<br>
ds_map_add(interactiveMap, "caption", "MacSweeneygames.com");<br>
ds_map_add(interactiveMap, "description", "Play Catch the clown now on MacSweeney Games!");<br>
facebook_dialog("feed", interactiveMap, -1);<br>
ds_map_destroy(interactiveMap);<br>
</p>
<p>
The above code will create a ds_map and store it's index in the local variable "interactiveMap". This map is then filled with the necessary key/value pairs to generate an interactive wall post. Next 
the <tt>facebook_dialog</tt> will open a window asking the user to add a message to be sent along with the rest of the information and this will all be published to the users wall. Finally the 
ds_map is deleted to free memory.
