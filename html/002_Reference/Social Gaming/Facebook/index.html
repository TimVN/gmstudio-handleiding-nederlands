<h1>Facebook</h1>

<h2>This section explains all the Facebook API functions.</h2>

<p>
Facebook is one of the most important social media on the internet and many games and developers currently have their own pages for posting games and media. <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> has a number 
of built in functions that permit you to connect with Facebook and get user information as well as post images and text to walls and a number of other things. It is recommended that you visit the 
<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook Developers</a> page before starting to use these functions as a firm understanding of how the Facebook Graph works and the available calls and 
permissions is essential for you to get the most from these functions.
<br>
<br>

<i><b>NOTE : </b>If your test device has the Facebook App installed, these functions will only work when creating an executable, as just testing the game (using the green or orange "play" buttons) will not 
work correctly.  Basically, the test runner and the FaceBook App communicate with one another so the mechanism for communication has to be correctly setup, and you only get it correctly setup via the Create 
Application button.</i>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Android Apps</h3>
<p>
When you set up your Facebook page to accept an Android app, there are certain things that are important to note. The first thing is that the <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> Android Facebook functions currently 
do not support <b>Android SSO</b> nor <b>Android Native Deep Linking</b> so please leave them disabled. This also means that the <b>Android Package Name</b> and <b>Android Class Name</b> 
are not relevant since they are only required fields for native linking, meaning that they can be left blank too.
<br>
<br>

There is also a section where you are required to enter the Android Keystore <b>Hash</b> that is unique to the keystore that you are using for your game. As this can be quite difficult to get, 
<i>Gamemaker:Studio</i> can generate it for you from the <a href="../../../001_Advanced%20Use/Preferences/Android%20Preferences.html">Android Preferences</a>, and you can then simply copy and paste 
it into the required part of the Facebook setup page.
<br>
<br>

The image below shows how your final Facebook Android section should look:

<h3>iOS Apps</h3>
<p>
The basic setup for iOS apps with the Facebook functions is the same as for Android, however there are a few key things that need to be correctly set up on the actual Facebook Developers page for your app:
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Bundle ID</b>: Must match with the bundle ID of your game (usually of the form "com.{yourcompany}.{yourgame}").
		<li><b>iPhone App Store ID</b>: This is the Apple ID associated with your game as found on iTunes Connect for the iPhone game.
		<li><b>iPad App Store ID</b>: As above except for iPad.
		<li><b>Facebook Login</b>: <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> supports <b>Single Sign-On</b> for iOS apps, so you can enable this to allow the game to be launched from the iOS Facebook app.
		<li><b>Deep Linking</b>: This is not supported, so keep disabled.
		<li><b>URL Scheme Suffix</b>: This is not supported, so leave blank.
	</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>HTML5 Apps</h3>
<p>
The HTML5 target works almost exactly the same as all previous target modules, however <i>you cannot test the functions locally</i>, meaning that you will have to compile and upload to your server to test. 
There is also one additional function that has been added to create offerwall compatability for HTML5 games that is not available for other platforms:
<blockquote>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="facebook_launch_offerwall.html">facebook_launch_offerwall</a><br>  
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
The functions listed below are for integrating your game with Facebook:
<blockquote>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="facebook_init.html">facebook_init</a><br>
		<li><a href="facebook_login.html">facebook_login</a><br> 
		<li><a href="facebook_status.html">facebook_status</a><br>
		<li><a href="facebook_accesstoken.html">facebook_accesstoken</a><br>  
		<li><a href="facebook_user_id.html">facebook_user_id</a><br>  
		<li><a href="facebook_graph_request.html">facebook_graph_request</a><br> 
		<li><a href="facebook_dialog.html">facebook_dialog</a><br> 
		<li><a href="facebook_send_invite.html">facebook_send_invite</a><br> 
		<li><a href="facebook_post_message.html">facebook_post_message</a><br> 
		<li><a href="facebook_logout.html">facebook_logout</a><br>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
<i><b>NOTE : </b>You must have activated the Facebook API in the <a href="../../../001_Advanced%20Use/Global%20game%20settings/Facebook%20Tab.html">Global Game Settings</a> <b>and</b> called the 
<code>facebook_init()</code> function before any of these functions can be used correctly.</i>
