<p class="code">instance_change(obj, perf);</p>

	<tr><th>Argument</th><th>Description</th></tr>
	
	<tr><td>obj</td>
	<td>The new object the calling object will change into.</td></tr>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
You can use this function to change one instance of an object into another instance of a different object, and while doing so decide whether to perform the initial instances destroy event and the new instances 
create event. In this way, you can have (for example) a bomb change into an explosion - in which case the "perf" argument would probably be true as you would want the bomb to perform its destroy event, as 
well as the explosion to perform its create event - or you could have your player character change into a different one - in which case the "perf" argument would probably be false as you do not want the instances 
to perform their create and destroy events.
<br>
<br>

It is worth noting that changing the instance means that you should perform no further actions with that instance until the next step, in particluar trying to access variables etc... as that will cause an error. 
Basically, you change the instance but it is not actually available until the end of the current step, so to access any of the variables it contains directly (for example, calling <code>obj_Changed.x</code>) 
will not work.
<br>
<br>

 <p>
<br>
</p>

<p><b>Example :</b></p>
<p class="code">
if keyboard_check(vk_enter)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instance_change(obj_Player_Swimming, 0);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exit;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
</p>
<p>
The above code will change the calling instance into an instance of "obj_Player_Swimming" without performing the original instances destroy event nor the new instances create event when the user preses the 
"Enter" key, exiting the code block when done.
