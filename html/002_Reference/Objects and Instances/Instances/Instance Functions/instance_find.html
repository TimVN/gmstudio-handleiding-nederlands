<h1>instance_find</h1>
  
<h2>Returns the id of the (n)th instance of a given object.<br></h2>
  
<h3><b>Syntax :</b></h3>
<p class="code">instance_find(obj, n);</p>
  
<p>
<br>
</p>

<div class="param"> 
<table>
	<tr><th>Argument</th><th>Description</th></tr>
	
	<tr><td>obj</td>
	<td>The object index of which to find the nth instance</td></tr>
	
	<tr class="alt"><td>n</td>
	<td>The number of the instance to find, based on the order in which they were created.</td></tr>

</table>
</div>

<p>
<br>
</p>
  
<p>
<b>Returns :</b> instance id or <b>noone</b>
</p>
  
 <p>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
All instances have a unique identifier (<a href="../../Instances/Instance%20Properties/id.html"><tt>id</tt></a>) which can be used to modify and manipulate them while a game is running, but you may 
not always know what the id for a specific instance is and so this function can help as you can use it to iterate through all of them to find what you need. You specify the object that you want to find the 
instance of and a number, and if there is an instance at that position in the instance list then the function returns the id of that instance, and if not it returns the special keyword <b>noone</b>. You can 
also use the keyword <b>all</b> to iterate through all the instances in a room, as well as a parent object to iterate through all the instances that are part of that parent / child heirarchy and you can even 
specify an instance itself (if you have its id) as a check to see if it actually exists in the current room. Please note that as instances are sorted in an <i>arbitrary</i> manner, there is no specific order to 
how the instances are checked by this function.
<br>
<br>

The maximum value for "n" in this function would be
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>For the keyword <b>all</b> : <a href="instance_count.html"><tt>instance_count - 1</tt></a>
		<li>For an object index : <a href="instance_number.html"><tt>instance_number(OBJ) - 1</tt></a>
	</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Example :</h3>
<p class="code">
var i;<br>
for (i = 0; i &lt; instance_number(obj_Enemy); i += 1)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enemy[i] = instance_find(obj_Enemy,i);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
</p>
<p>
The above code will use a <tt>for</tt> loop to iterate through all the instances of "obj_Enemy" and strore their <b>id</b> in the array "enemy[]".
</p>
