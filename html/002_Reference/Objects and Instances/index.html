<h1>Objects and Instances</h1>

<h2>This section has all the functions directly related to objects and instances.</h2>
<p>

To make a game in <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> you will need to first define <b>objects</b> and add them to the resource tree. An object can contain a number of different 
<a href="../../000_Using%20GameMaker/Events/index.html">Events</a> and in each event you can use either GML code or D'n'D to define behaviours for that object. However, this object 
is <i>not</i> placed into the game, but rather acts as a template for <b>instances</b> which <i>are</i> placed into rooms. An instance is basically a copy of the object that is 
placed in the room of your game and so, in this way, you would create one wall <i>object</i> and then place 100 <i>instances</i> of it into the room to create your game world.
<br>
<br>

Another thing to understand about instances and objects is that once an instance is created it can be manipulated and changed through D'n'D or code on an individual basis with 
none of these changes necessarily affecting any other instance of this same object. For example, you can use the room editor <a href="../../001_Advanced%20Use/More%20about%20rooms/index.html">
Right Click instance menu</a> to change a single instance to have a different color or orientation and these changes will only be current for that instance. All further instances will be 
created exactly the same as the defined object template.
<br>
<br>
