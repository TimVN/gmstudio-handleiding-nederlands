<h1>delta_time</h1>
  
<h2>The time passed in microseconds between one step and another.</h2>

<h3>Syntax :</h3>
<p class="code">delta_time</p>

<p>
<br>
</p>
  
<p>
<b>Returns:</b> Real
</p>

 <p>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The purpose of delta timing is to eliminate the effects of the lag or slowness of computers that try to handle complex graphics or a lot of code. It is a value that can be added on to the speed of objects so that 
they will eventually move at the same speed, regardless of lag. This is achieved in <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> by using the <b>read only</b> variable <tt>delta_time</tt> every step as it measures the time 
that has passed between one step and the next in microseconds (1microsecond is 1,000,000th of a second). Therefore the variable <tt>delta_time</tt> can be used to calculate how much faster (for example) a 
game character has to move to make up for a lag spike in the game.
<br>
<br>

<p>
<br>
</p>
<h3> <b>Example :</b> </h3>
<p class="code">
speed = spd * (ot - delta_time);
 </p>
<p>
The above code will set the speed of the instance using delta-time to correct for lag. The variable "ot" would be used to hold the previously calculated delta_time value so that the ratio can be used to multiply the 
base speed value (held in the variable "spd") and so get a consistent speed for the instance.
