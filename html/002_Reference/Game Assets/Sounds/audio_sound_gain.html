<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
With this function you can fade a sound in or out over a given length of time. The time is measured in milliseconds, and the function requires that you input a final level of gain for the sound to have reached by the 
end of that time. This gain can be between 0 (silent) and 1 (full volume) and the scale is logarithmic in nature, so a gain of 0.5 is <i>not</i> half volume, as illustrated by the image below:
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

This function will affect all instances of the sound that are playing currently in the room if the index is a sound resource, and the final volume will be the volume at which all further instances of the sound will be played. 
However if you have used the index returned from a function like <a href="audio_play_sound.html"><tt>audio_play_sound</tt></a> it will only affect that one instance of the sound.
<br>
<br>

<p>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Example :</h3>
<p class="code">
if val<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var snd = audio_play_sound(snd_fountain);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;audio_sound_gain(snd, 0, 0);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;audio_sound_gain(snd, 1, 5000);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
</p>
<p>
The above code checks a variable and if it returns <tt>true</tt> it will then assign the index of a sound to be played to the local variable "snd". This variable is then used to reduce the volume of that specific sound 
to 0 and fade up to full volume over 5 seconds.
