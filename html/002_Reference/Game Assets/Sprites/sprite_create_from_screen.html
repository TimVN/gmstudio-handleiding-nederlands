<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
With this function you can create a sprite from an image on the screen. The screen is defined as the area of the game window where everything is displayed, so the x and y coordinates that you must 
input are relative to the (0,0) position of the game window (the top left corner). The width and height arguments are in pixels and define the width and height of the part of the screen to use.
<br>
<br>

Setting the "removeback" argument to <tt>true</tt> will remove a color from the sprite, by checking the <i>bottom left</i> pixel of the sprite for the color there and then using that as the color 
to be removed.
<br>
<br>

If you choose the "removeback" option, you may also want <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> to smooth the edges of the sprite by setting the "smooth" argument to <tt>true</tt>. All this does is create a semi-transparent 
border around the dges of the sprite after it has had it's background removed.
<br>
<br>

Finally you can also specify the x and y <i>origin</i> for the sprite. This is the point where the sprite is "fixed" onto the instance that uses it, and is always calculated as relative to the 0,0 top left corner of 
one sprite sub-image. So, for example, a sprite that is 32 x 32 pixels with these values set to (16,16) will have it's origin in the center.
<br>
<br>

By default all new sprites have their bounding boxes calculated automatically (the exact bbox will depend on the size and transparency of the sprite), however you may wish to customise this, in which case 
you should also use the function <a href="sprite_collision_mask.html"><tt>sprite_collision_mask</tt></a>.
<br>
<br>

<i><b>NOTE : </b>When you create a sprite in GameMaker:Studio with this method you must remember to remove it again (with <a href="sprite_delete.html"><tt>sprite_delete</tt></a>) when no longer 
needed, otherwise there is risk of a memory leak which will slow down and eventually crash your game.</i>
<br>

<h3>Example :</h3>
<p class="code">
if keyboard_check_pressed(vk_enter)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if !sprite_exists(spr_Custom)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spr_custom = sprite_create_from_screen(0, 0, 32, 32, false, false, 16, 16);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
</p>
<p>
The above code checks to see if a sprite has been assigned to the variable "spr_Custom" when a key is pressed. If the check returns <tt>false</tt>, a sprite is created form the screen and it's index is stored.
