<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
This  function will delete a sprite from the game, freeing any memory that was reserved for it. This is a <i>permanent</i> removal, and if the asset that you delete was included as part of the game's resources, 
not even restarting the game (unless you close the application first) will recover it. This is a very important function for those mements when you need to create and change sprites from external resources and 
should always be used to remove those assets that are no longer needed by a game, or to clear an indexed asset from a variable before re-assigning another asset to that variable.
<br>
<br>

<i><b>NOTE : </b>This functionality is limited to the <a href="../../../000_Using%20GameMaker/Versions.html">Standard Version</a> of <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> and above.</i>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Example :</h3>
<p class="code">
var spr;<br>
spr = sprite_create_from_screen(0, 0, 32, 32, false, false, 16, 16);<br>
sprite_merge(spr_Player, spr);<br>
sprite_delete(spr);<br>
</p>
<p>
The above code creates a local variable and then stores the index of the sprite created from the screen. This sprite is then merged with the asset indexed in the variable "spr_Player" before being 
removed from memory again.
