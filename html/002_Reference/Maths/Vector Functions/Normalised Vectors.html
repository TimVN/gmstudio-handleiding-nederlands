<h1>Normalised Vectors</h1>

<h2>This section explains what a normalised vector is and how it can be used.</h2>

<p>
Ordinarily, vectors can be used in many situations but sometimes you want to constrain their value (like when dealing with angles) which is why we <i>normalise</i> them. This is essentially a mathematical 
trick that is used to convert a vector of length <i>n</i> to a vector of length 1, meaning that the vector components get normalised to be between 0 and 1. These vectors are also called <i>unit vectors</i> :<br>

<p>
To calculate a normalised vector, we must first have the original vector components, then use them to get the length of the vector. We then divide each of the vector components by this length to get the normalised 
vector componets which form the normalised vector in which the sum of the squares of all coordinates is equal to 1. Here's how :<br>
<br>

<img class="center" src="2d_norm_vector_image_1.png"></img>

<p>
First we take the coordinates of the vector and get the components :<br>
<br>

<p class="code">
vx = (x2 - x1) = (7 - 1) = 6<br>
vy = (y2 - y1) = (4 - 1) = 3<br>
</p>

<p>
<br>
We then use these values to calculate the length of the vector :<br>
<br>

<p class="code">
len = sqr(vx<sup>2</sup> + vy<sup>2</sup>) = sqr(36 + 9) = sqr(45) = 6.708203932499369<br>
</p>

<p>
<br>
Now, that gives us the exact length of the vector <i>a</i>, so lets use that to normalise the two vector components <i>vx</i> and <i>vy</i> :<br>
<br>

<p class="code">
vx = (vx/len) = (6 / 6.708203932499369) = 0.8944271909999159<br>
vy = (vy/len) = (3 / 6.708203932499369) = 0.4472135954999579<br>
a = 1<br>
</p>

<p>
<br>
Great! We have now normalised the components of the vector! But of what <i>practical</i> use is that in the context of <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>? Okay, lets give you a practical example...
</p>

<p>
Say you have a game where the player has to shoot at an enemy and you need to know how much the bullet object has to move along the x and y axis each step to hit it :<br>
<br>

<img class="center" src="2d_norm_vector_image_2.png"></img>

<p>
For this you would use the player and enemy coordinates to get the vector components and the length, then you would normalise them to get a value betwen 0 and 1 which you would finally multiply by the speed you wish the bullet to travel 
at each step. These final two values you would then store and add onto the starting x and y coordinates each step. Sound complicated? It's not, look (values have been rounded to one decimal place for simplicity) :<br>
<br>

<p class="code">
px = 100;<br>
py = 425;<br>
ex = 356;<br>
ey = 83;<br>
bullet_speed = 5;<br>
<br>
vx = (ex - px) = 256<br>
vy = (ey - py) = -342<br>
<br>
len = sqr(vx<sup>2</sup> + vy<sup>2</sup>) = sqr(65536 + 116964) = 427.2<br>
<br>
vx = vx / len = 0.6<br>
vy = vy / len = 0.8<br>
<br>
speed_x = vx * bullet_speed = 3<br>
speed_y = vy * bullet_speed = 4<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>
<br>
So, to hit the target we need to add 3 to the bullets x coordinate and 4 to its y coordinate every step.
