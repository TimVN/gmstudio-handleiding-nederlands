<h1>Obsolete Transition Functions</h1>
  
<h2>
These functions deal with splash screens and videos.
</h2>
<p>
  
<h3> <b>Function List :</b> </h3>
<div class="param">
<table>
	<tr><th>Function</th><th>Description</th></tr>

	<tr><td>transition_kind</td><td>Indicates the next room transition. You can use the following builtin values</td></tr>
	
	<tr class="alt"><td>transition_steps</td><td>Indicates the number of steps in the transition. The more steps, the longer the transition takes. Default is 80.</td></tr>

	<tr><td>transition_define</td><td>You can actually create your own transitions. To this end you must define a script (possibly in an extension package) to do the transition. 
	With this function you can then add the transition to the system. kind is the index of the transition (either a new one or an existing transitions). name is the name of the script. 
	Note that the name of the script is a string! So there must be quotes around it. Note that this is really advanced stuff. The script must take five arguments: a surface with the image 
	of the previous room, a surface with the image of the next room, the width of the surfaces, the height of the surfaces, and the fraction of the transition (between 0 and 1). It must then 
	draw the image using the two surfaces. </td></tr>
	
	<tr class="alt"><td>transition_exists</td><td>This function returns whether a transition of the indicated kind exists.</td></tr>
	
</table>

<h3> <b>Why These Are Obsolete</b> </h3>
<p>
These functions have been removed due to the fact that they more or less "take over" control of the device to work. They are also incompatible with the way <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> now handles graphics.
