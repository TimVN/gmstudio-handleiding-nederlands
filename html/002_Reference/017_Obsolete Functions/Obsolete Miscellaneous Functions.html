<h1>Obsolete Miscellaneous Functions</h1>
  
<h2>
These functions are general ones related to previous versions of <i>GameMaker</i>.
</h2>
<p>
 
<h3> <b>Variable Function List :</b> </h3>
<div class="param">
<table>
	<tr><th>Function</th><th>Description</th></tr>

	<tr><td>secure_mode</td><td>Returns whether the game is running in secure mode or not.</td></tr>
	
	<tr class="alt"><td>set_program_priority</td><td>Sets the priority for the program. You can indicate a value between -3 and +3. A value of -3 means that the program will only run if no other process 
	on the computer requires processing time, or stated differently, when all other processes are idle. Values of -2 and -1 are below normal, so other processes will get priority. 0 is the normal value. +1 and 
	+2 give a higher priority, resulting possibly in higher speed and smoother game flow. But other processes will get much less processing time. +3 indicates real-time mode. In real-time mode basically all time 
	is allotted to the game. This can lead to serious problems with any other applications running on the computer. Also keyboard events and e.g. the pressing of the close box might no longer be recorded by 
	Windows. So only use this if you want all the processor time. Also better check carefully before using it and save the game before running.</td></tr>

	<tr><td>set_application_title</td><td>Sets the title of the application to the given string. The title is for example shown in the task bar.</td></tr>
	
	<tr class="alt"><td>export_include_file</td><td>Exports the included file with the name fname. This must be a string variable, so don't forget the quotes.</td></tr>

	<tr><td>export_include_file_location</td><td>Exports the included file with the name fname to the given location. Location must contain the path and the filename.</td></tr>
	
	<tr class="alt"><td>discard_include_file</td><td>Discard the included file with the name fname, freeing the memory used. This must be a string variable, so don't forget the quotes.</td></tr>

	<tr><td>gamemaker_pro</td><td>Indicates whether the game is created with the Standard Edition.</td></tr>
	
	<tr class="alt"><td>gamemaker_registered</td><td>Same as gamemaker_pro.</td></tr>

	<tr><td>gamemaker_version</td><td>The version of GameMaker. This is an integer. For version 8.0 this can be anything between 800 and 809. For version 8.1 this will be something between 810 and 819, etc. 
	so never check a particular version but better check for a range. This variable is not available in version before 800.</td></tr>
	
	<tr class="alt"><td>error_last</td><td>String indicating the last error message.</td></tr>

	<tr><td>error_occurred</td><td>Indicates whether an error has occurred.</td></tr>
	
	<tr class="alt"><td>sleep</td><td>Sleeps numb milliseconds.</td></tr>
	
	<tr><td>io_handle</td><td>Update the input state from mouse or keyboard.</td></tr>
	
	<tr class="alt"><td>keyboard_wait</td><td>Waits till the user presses a key on the keyboard.</td></tr>
	
	<tr><td>mouse_wait</td><td>Waits till the user presses a mouse button.</td></tr>	
	
	<tr class="alt"><td>disk_size</td><td>Returns the size of the indicated drive in bytes.</td></tr>
	
	<tr><td>disk_free</td><td>Returns the amount of free space on the indicated drive in bytes.</td></tr>
	
	<tr class="alt"><td>date_current_date</td><td>Returns the date corresponding to the current moment.</td></tr>
	
	<tr><td>date_current_time</td><td>Returns the time corresponding to the current moment.</td></tr>
	
	<tr class="alt"><td>date_create_date</td><td> Creates a date-time value corresponding to the indicated date.</td></tr>
	
	<tr><td>date_create_time</td><td> Creates a date-time value corresponding to the indicated time.</td></tr>
	
	<tr class="alt"><td>date_valid_date</td><td>Returns whether the indicated date is valid.</td></tr>
	
	<tr><td>date_valid_time</td><td>Returns whether the indicated time is valid.</td></tr>

<h3> <b>Why These Are Obsolete</b> </h3>
<p>
These functions cannot be used any more due to changes in the underlying runner that <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> uses and the fact that most of them are no longer relevant to any other device except Windows.
