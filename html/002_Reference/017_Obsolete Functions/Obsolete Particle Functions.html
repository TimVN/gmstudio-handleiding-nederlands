<h1>Obsolete Particle Functions</h1>
  
<h2>
These functions deal with the manipulation of particles.
</h2>
<p>
The following functions for particle attractors have been removed :

<div class="param">
<table>
	<tr><th>Function</th><th>Description</th></tr>

	<tr><td>part_attractor_create</td><td>Creates a new attractor in the given particle system. It returns the index of the attractor. This index must be used in all calls below to set the properties of the attractor.</td></tr>
	
	<tr class="alt"><td>part_attractor_destroy</td><td>Destroys attractor ind in the particle system. Call this if you don't need it anymore to save space.</td></tr>	
	
	<tr><td>part_attractor_destroy_all</td><td>Destroys all attractors in the particle system that have been created.</td></tr>
	
	<tr class="alt"><td>part_attractor_exists</td><td> Returns whether the indicated attractor exists in the particle system.</td></tr>

	<tr><td>part_attractor_clear</td><td>Clears the attractor ind to its default settings.</td></tr>
	
	<tr class="alt"><td>part_attractor_position</td><td>Sets the position of attractor ind to (x,y).</td></tr>

	<tr><td>part_attractor_force</td><td>Sets the force parameters of attractor ind.</td></tr>

<p>
The following functions for particle changers have been removed :

<div class="param">
<table>

<h3> <b>Why These Are Obsolete</b> </h3>
<p>
Particles are normally very fast to process due to the fact that they are normally just graphical effects which, once fired off, are left to do their own thing based on the parameters set for them when you created 
the system. These routines, however, could be used to change particle properties <i>after</i> they have been created in a game, which means that each particle has to be tracked and dealt with in an individual 
manner. As this is horribly slow and defeats the purpose of particles (as they are meant to be used for fast graphical effects)
