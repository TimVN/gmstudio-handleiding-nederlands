<h1>Obsolete Splash Functions</h1>
  
<h2>
These functions deal with splash screens and videos.
</h2>
<p>
  
<h3> <b>Function List :</b> </h3>
<div class="param">
<table>
	<tr><th>Function</th><th>Description</th></tr>

	<tr><td>splash_show_video</td><td>Shows a video splash screen. fname is the name of the video file. Whether a particular movie file is supported depends on the drivers on the machine. 
	Typically you can use .avi, .mpg, and .wmv files but avoid special codecs. You best put this file in the folder of the game yourself or in a subfolder. loop indicates whether to loop the video.</td></tr>
	
	<tr class="alt"><td>splash_show_text</td><td> Shows a text splash screen. fname is the name of the text file. You can either display standard text files (.txt) or rich text files (.rtf). Only part of 
	the rich text features are taken into account. E.g. images and other embedded objects are not shown. delay indicates the delay in milliseconds before returning to the game. use 0 or a negative value 
	to wait until the player presses the escape key or clicks with the mouse in the window. (Note that no scrollbar will be shown nor is there another way to scroll the text. So the text must fit the window.)</td></tr>

	<tr><td>splash_show_image</td><td>Shows an image splash screen. fname is the name of the image file. Many image types are supported (for example .bmp, .jpg, .tif, and .wmf) but no animated 
	images. delay is the delay in milli seconds before returning to the game.</td></tr>
	
	<tr class="alt"><td>splash_show_web</td><td>Shows a web page splash screen. url is the url of the webpage (starting with http://) or it is the file name for a local html file. Note however that 
	you must provide the full path for this to work. So you best e.g. use as url something like working_directory + "\index.html". delay is the delay in milli seconds before returning to the game</td></tr>

<h3> <b>Why These Are Obsolete</b> </h3>
<p>
These are Windows only functions and no longer applicable to any other device, especially since they block the runner to show the splash screens.
