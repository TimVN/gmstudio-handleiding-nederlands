<h3> <b>Why These Are Obsolete</b> </h3>
<p>
These are Windows only functions and no longer applicable to any other device, especially since most of them block the runner to show the message boxes.
<br>
<br>
<i><b>Note : </b>While the highscore display functions are now obsolete, the internal highscores do still exists and can be used... You will just have to display them yourself through your own code.</i>
