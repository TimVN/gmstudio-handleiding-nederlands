<h1>d3d_start</h1>
  
<h2>Tells <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> that all further drawing is to be done in 3D mode.</h2>

<h3>Syntax :</h3>
<p class="code">d3d_start()</p>

<p>
<br>
</p>
  
<p>
<b>Returns : </b>Real
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
With this function you can tell <i>GamerMaker:Studio</i> that all further drawing should be done in 3D mode. This function can be called in any event, but will affect <i>all drawing</i> done after, so if your game 
is not completely done in 3D you may need to switch it off using <a href="d3d_end.html"><tt>d3d_end</tt></a> to draw certain parts (and then use this function again to switch 3D mode back on).
<br>
<br>

Starting 3D mode will result in the following changes :
<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>First of all depth testing (also known as Z Buffering) is switched on (using a 24-bit z-buffer). This means that for each pixel on the screen only the drawing with the smallest z-value (= depth value) is drawn. If instances
	have the same depth then you will get what is known as Z-fighting. This occurs as the 2 instances attempt to draw at the same level, and inaccuracys in the rendering due to very close Z value cause ugly effects. To avoid 
	this, try and make sure instances that might overlap do not have the same depth value!</li><br>

	<li>Secondly, the normal orthographic projection is replaced by a perspective one. This means the following. Normally the size of instances on the screen is independent on its depth. With a perspective projection instances
	that have a greater depth will appear smaller. When the depth is 0 it is equal to the old size (unless you change the projection). The viewpoint for the camera is placed at a distance above the room. (This distance 
	is equal to the width of the room; that gives a reasonable default projection.) Only instances in front of the camera are drawn. So don't use instances with a depth smaller than 0 (or at least not smaller than -w where w is the 
	width of the room or the view).</li><br>

	<li>Thirdly, the vertical y-coordinate is reversed. While normally the (0,0) position is at the top-left of the view, in 3D mode the (0,0) position is at the bottom-left position, as is normal for 3-dimensional views.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>Example :</h3>
<p class="code">
d3d_start();
</p>
<p>
This code has been placed in the create event of an instance to tell <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> that all further drawing should be done in 3D mode.
