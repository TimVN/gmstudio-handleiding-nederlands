<h1>Programs</h1>

<h2>Here you can find out how a basic program is structured using GML.</h2>

<p>
A program consists of a set of instructions, called statements, that are then interpreted by <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> and used to make something happen within your game. That "something" can be as simple as 
adding 2 and 2 to get 4, or as complex as making an enemy run away when their health gets below a certain value. The actual structure of the program can vary greatly, depending on the functions it uses, but broken 
down to basics it just looks like this :
<br>
<br>

<p>
  <p class="code">{<br>
  &lt;statement&gt;;<br>
  &lt;statement&gt;;<br>
  ...<br>
}</p>

<p>
A program must start with the symbol '{' and end with the symbol '}', and between these symbols there are the statements, which must be separated with a ';' symbol.
Here is a more visual representation of how a program can look, this time created as a <b>script</b> in the <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> <a href="../../001_Advanced%20Use/006_Scripts.html">Script Editor</a> :

<p>
There are a number of different types of statements, which are discussed at length in subsequent sections of the manual.
