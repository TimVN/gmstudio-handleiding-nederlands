<h1>Comments in Code</h1>

<h2>This section deals with the ways in which you can comment your codes and scripts.</h2>
<p>

When working in collaboration with other people, when dealing with a large project, or even just for your own refrence and debugging, leaving comments in your codes and scripts is very important. 
In <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> you have various mechanisms to help you leave notes and comments about code sections and even whole blocks of code that can be seen in the event list of the 
object that you are currently editing, and in this way you can leave notes to yourself and to your colleagues, or to explain a particularly tricky piece of code, or even just leave a reminder about what something does.
<br>
<br>

the first thing you can do is leave a short comment using <b>//</b> before the text. For example :
<br>
<br>
<p class="code">
//initialise variables<br>
sr = 10;<br>
hp = 100;<br>
</p>

<p>
<br>
You may also leave multiline comments, to give credit, to omit a complete section of code for debugging, or even to explain the arguments of a script. For that you can use <b>/* ... */</b> like this :
<br>
<br>
<p class="code">
/*<br>
usage:<br>
diff = angle_difference(angle1,angle2);<br>
<br>
angle1    first direction in degrees, real<br>
angle2    second direction in degrees, real<br>
<br>
returns: difference of the given angles in degrees, -180 to 180<br>
<br>
GMLscripts.com<br>
*/<br>
{<br>
return ((((argument0 - argument1) mod 360) + 540) mod 360) - 180;<br>
}<br>
</p>

<p>
<br>
Finally, when using the code blocks in an object, it can be quite confusing, especially if you have many of them and any given event may end up looking like this :

<img class="center" src="NoComments.png"></img>

However if the <i>very first line of your code</i> has a comment that is started with <b>///</b> then that comment will appear as the name of that code block. So, for example, if you have this :
<br>
<br>
<p class="code">
///Check position<br>
</p>

<p>
<br>
Then the code block will now have that as it's description, as shown in the following image :

<img class="center" src="Comments.png"></img>

<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>

<div class="clear">

	<div style="float:right">
