<h1>get_login_async</h1>
  
<h2>An asynchronous function that returns the username and password.</h2>
  
<h3>Syntax :</h3>
<p class="code">get_login_async(name, password);</p>

<p>
<br>
</p>

<div class="param">
<table>
	<tr><th>Argument</th><th>Description</th></tr>

	<tr><td>username</td>
	<td>The default user name</td></tr>
	
	<tr class="alt"><td>password</td>
	<td>The default password</td></tr>

</table>
</div>

<p>
<br>
</p>
  
<p>
<b>Returns : </b>Real
</p>

 <p>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
This function opens a window that asks the user to input a username and password. These arguments can be set as an empty string or you can store previously entered values to use if you wish. 
This is an asynchronous function, and as such <i>GameMaker:Studio</i> does <i>not</i> block the device it is being run on while waiting for answer, but rather keeps on running events as normal. 
Once the user has input the details and pressed the "Okay" button, an asynchronous <b>User Interaction</b> event is triggered which, for the duration of that event <i>only</i>, will have a 
ds_map stored in the variable <tt>async_load</tt>.
<br>
<br>

This map will contain the two keys, "username" and "password", with the corresponding user input stored in each. As it is a <a href="../Data%20Structures/DS%20Maps/index.html"<tt>ds_map</tt></a> 
that has been created, this can then be used, for example, by the <a href="../File%20Handling/json_encode.html"><tt>json_encode</tt></a> function ready to be sent to a server or written to a file on 
the chosen device. 
<br>
<br>

It is worth noting that this function will return an index number for the ds_map created which can then be checked in the corresponding event so that you can "target" a specific ds_map should you be expecting 
more than one async map to be returned (perhaps from some other function). Outside of the asynchronoous events, the async_load ds_map will return an "id" value of -1.
<br>
<br>

<p>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Extended Example :</h3>
<p>
The <b>create event</b> (for example) of the object that is controlling the login of our user would have the following code:
<p class="code">
ini_open("Profile.ini");<br>
u = ini_read_string("User","0","");<br>
p = ini_read_string("User","1","");<br>
ini_close();<br>
login = get_login_async(u,p);<br>
</p>
<p>
The above code opens an ini file (or creates one if it doesn't exist) and gets the name and password stored in that file. If they do not exist, then the default of an empty string ("") is returned. These values are then 
used in <tt>get_login_async()</tt> to ask the user for their username and password details, with the request index being stored in the variable "login". Note that while waiting for the user to give the necessary 
information the game and it's events will continue to run as normal.
<br>
<br>

Now that the asynchronous code has been fired off, we need to check for the return value in the <a href="../../001_Advanced%20Use/More%20About%20Async%20Events/Dialogs.html">asynchronous event for Dialogs</a> in the 
following way:
<p class="code">
if ds_map_find_value(async_load, "id") == login<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;u = ds_map_find_value(async_load, "username");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p = ds_map_find_value(async_load, "password");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
</p>
<p>
The above code checks the "id" key of the async_load ds_map and if it holds the same value as that stored in the "login" variable, the map details are then read into the corresponding variables which you can then 
store or use to check against database values etc...
