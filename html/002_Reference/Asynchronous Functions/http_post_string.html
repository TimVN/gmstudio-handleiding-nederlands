<h1>http_post_string</h1>
  
<h2>This function not only retrieves information from the supplied URL, but sends data as part of the retrieval request.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
In computing, a <b>post</b> request is used when the client needs to send data to the server as part of the retrieval request, such as when uploading a file or submitting a completed form, and the 
same is true of this function in <i>GameMaker:Studio</i>. In contrast to the <t>http_get</tt> request method where only a URL is sent to the server, <tt>http_post_string()</tt> also includes a 
string that is sent to the server and may result in the creation of a new resource or the update of an existing resource or both. It should be noted that HTTP request parameters (the bits sometimes 
"tacked on" to the end of a URL when you submit a form on a web page) are perfectly acceptable when using this function too.
<br>
<br>

This event will generate a "call back" which is picked up by any <a href="../../001_Advanced%20Use/More%20About%20Async%20Events/HTTP.html"> HTTP Events</a>, in which case it will generate a 
<a href="../Data%20Structures/DS%20Maps/index.html"<tt>ds_map</tt></a> (more commonly known as a "dictionary") that is exclusive to this event and is stored in the special variable <b>async_load</b>. 
This ds_map has the following structure:
<blockquote>
<ol>
	<li><b>URL : </b>The complete URL you requested.</li><br>
	<li><b>result : </b>The data received (string only).</li><br>
	<li><b>http_status : </b>The raw http status code (if available). This returns the standard web status code for most browsers, eg: 304 for "Not Modified" or 204 for "No Content", etc...</li><br>
	<li><b>id : </b>The ID which was returned from the command. If you fire off a series of <tt>http_</tt> requests then you need to know which one you are getting the reply to, and so you would 
	use this value to compare to the value you stored when you originally sent the request to find the right one.</li><br>
	<li><b>status : </b> Returns a value of less than 0 for an error.</li><br>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
<i><b>NOTE : </b>You should be aware that due to XSS protection in browsers, requests to and attempts to load resources from across domains are blocked and 
may appear to return blank results. Please see the section on <a href="index.html">Cross Domain Issues</a> for further details.</i>

<h3>Extended Example :</h3>
<p>
The <tt>http_post_string</tt> function can be called from any event, and since it is asynchronous the callback can be almost instantaneous or could take several seconds. Calling the function is simple and would look 
something like this:
<p class="code">
var str;<br>
str = json_encode(game_info);<br>
get[0] = http_post_string("http://www.angusgames.com/game?game_id=" + string(global.game_id), str)<br>
</p>
<p>
The above code sends a retrieval request to the specified URL with the given parameters as well as sending the additional data (a JSON object string created using 
<a href="../File%20Handling/json_encode.html"><tt>json_encode</tt></a> from a ds_map) stored in the variable "str". This will trigger all defined Async Events if a callback is received, and 
you can check the id returned against that stored in the variable <tt>get[0]</tt> to make sure that you run the correct code should you have used various <tt>http_post_string()</tt> functions. The following 
example code shows how this would be done:
<p class="code">
if ds_map_find_value(async_load, "id") == get[0]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ds_map_find_value(async_load, "status") >= 0<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r_str = ds_map_find_value(async_load, "result");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r_str = "null";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
</p>
<p>
The above code will first check the id of the ds_map that has been created, then check the status of the callback. If the value is greater than or equal to 0 (signalling success) the result from the callback will 
then be stored in a variable for future use, otherwise the variable will be set to a default value (in this case "null").
