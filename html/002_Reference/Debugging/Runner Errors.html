<h1>Runner Errors</h1>

<h2>Here you can see the possible errors that the Virtual Machine runner can throw.</h2>

<p>
Even after syntax checking in the code editor and then having the compiler check your code, there are still occaisions when something can go wrong. in most cases this will throw a VM (<i>virtual machine</i>) 
error which ooks like this:

VM errors are generally more serious than compile errors as it means that there is something seriously wrong with your code that neither the code editor nor the compiler have been able to detect, and as such you 
should pay attention to all such errors. When one occurs, you can use the "copy" button on the pop-up to copy the error to the clipboard which you can then paste into a text file (or wherever) for future reference.

The possible errors from the VM runner are as follows:

<i><b>NOTE : </b>All runner errors will try and point you to the object or script that has caused the crash.</i>

		<li><b>General</b><br>
		<p class="code">DoCall :: Execution Engine type error</p>This is an undefined error within the Virtual Machine. You should file a bug report should this happen (see: 
		<a href="../../000_Using%20GameMaker/Drop%20Down%20Menus/The%20Help%20Menu.html">The Help Menu</a> for details on how to do this.</li><br>
		<p class="code">Stack Overflow...</p>A stack overflow occurs when too much memory is used on the call stack and when your game attempts to use more space than is available on the call stack (that is, 
		when it attempts to access memory beyond the call stack's bounds, which is essentially a buffer overflow), the stack is said to overflow, resulting in a program crash. Restart your computer and 
		<i>GameMaker:Studio</i> and if the error persists please get in touch with support and/or file a bug (as explained above).</li><br>
